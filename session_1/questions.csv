Cisco is committed to making our products and solutions 
responsibly, and that extends to our manufacturing partners 
and suppliers, including the standards they uphold for 
labor practices, health and safety, the environment, and 
human rights. We are a founding and active member of the 
Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and have long adopted 
the RBA Code of Conduct as our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
We evaluate our suppliers’ conformance to the Code and 
other policies by requesting self-assessments, conducting 
third-party audits, and driving collaborative solutions. We 
also work across the Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) industry to build supplier capacity to 
support a baseline of these standards.
Inclusive
We believe Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) is a core 
competency and lens that we leverage to accelerate and 
amplify Cisco’s existing business goals and mission. It is 
intrinsic to who we are — and who we intend to be long into 
the future. We promote inclusivity through our Conscious 
Culture, our set of expectations, principles, and measures 
that define Cisco’s values, beliefs, and ethos. Our values 
and expectations are laid out in our Code of Business 
Conduct. Every employee must certify compliance with the 
code each year to help uphold integrity in the workplace and 
the ethical use of data and resources, and to help prevent 
conflicts of interest. Living a Conscious Culture requires us 
to act with dignity, respect, fairness, and equity in each of 
our interactions with one another, allowing us to become a 
catalyst for social change.
When people are respected for who they are and 
encouraged to seek balance between work and personal 
life, we believe they are more productive and successful 
in their jobs and able to give their best to their families and 
communities. In fiscal 2016, we set a goal to achieve 80% 
employee participation in community impact by 2020. We 
achieved that goal in 2020, and have sustained or exceeded 
80% employee participation every year since then.
Cisco has always strived to compensate our employees 
fairly and equitably. We are a signatory of the White 
House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, 
and we are a leader in the charge to make fair pay a 
reality for all employees through the Employers for Pay 
Equity Consortium.",15

2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,What were the factors that made auditing Amazon's tax contingencies challenging in 2024?,2024-amazon-annual-report-10K,data/2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,The report is about Amazon and covers the year 2024.,"Uncertain Tax Positions
Description of
the Matter
As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income 
taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are 
many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment 
is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The 
Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more 
likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $6.5 billion for various tax 
contingencies.
Auditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because 
the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the 
benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management’s 
evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted 
by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
Audit
We tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, 
including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; 
the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the 
development of the related disclosures. 
We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in 
assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the 
specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our 
procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s 
correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions 
are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income 
tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax 
contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential 
effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the 
appropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data 
used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company’s income tax 
disclosures in relation to these matters.

2024-meta-full-annual-report.pdf,"Here is a question based strictly on the provided chunk and its context from the Meta Platforms, Inc. 2024 annual financial results summary:

**What are Meta Platforms, Inc.’s management team expecting for first quarter 2025 total revenue, and what key factors are driving their expense and capital expenditure outlook for full year 2025?**",2024-meta-full-annual-report,data/2024-meta-full-annual-report.pdf,"The report is about Meta Platforms, Inc. and covers the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.","CFO Outlook Commentary
We expect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8 billion. This reflects 8-15% year-over-year 
growth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% 
headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap 
day in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we 
are making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 
2025.
We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense 
growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation(1). We expect employee 
compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, 
Reality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.
We anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures 
growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The 
majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.
Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.
In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and 
the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.
____________________________________
(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in 
their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of 
December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately 
$2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.

In periods 
of growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical 
lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.
We have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term 
manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific 
region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung 
Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from Micron Technology, 
Inc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with 
independent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron 
Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.

**How has Reddit, Inc. as of December 31, 2024, protected its intellectual property assets, and what measures are in place to safeguard proprietary technologies from unauthorized access?**[1]",2024-reddit-annual-report-10K,data/2024-reddit-annual-report-10K.pdf,"The report is about Reddit, Inc. and covers the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.","Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies, and we rely on 
intellectual property rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret 
laws, license agreements, internal procedures, and contractual provisions. We also enter into confidentiality and invention 
assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and sign confidentiality agreements with third parties. Our internal 
controls restrict access to proprietary technology.
As of December 31, 2024, we had 51 pending trademark applications and 346 trademark registrations around the world. 
We also had 123 copyright registrations on various graphical designs and literary works and two pending utility patent 
applications and three provisional patent applications in the United States as of December 31, 2024. See “Risk Factors—Risks 
Related to Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Intellectual Property” for more information regarding risks related to our 
intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Regulation
We are subject to many U.S. federal and state and foreign laws, rules, and regulations, including those related to privacy, 
rights of publicity, data protection, content regulation, intellectual property, health and safety, competition, protection of 
minors, consumer protection, and taxation. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, 
created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business.
Furthermore, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation, and other laws and regulations are 
often more restrictive than those in the United States. It is possible that certain governments may seek to block or limit our 
products or otherwise impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility or usability of any or all our products for an 
extended period of time or indefinitely. We have a legal and a public policy team that monitor legal and regulatory 
developments in the United States, as well as globally, and communicates regularly with policymakers and regulators.

Governmental Regulation and Litigation.”
Building the Future of the Internet at Reddit
To empower communities and make their knowledge accessible to all on Reddit, we believe that we must do so at Reddit 
first. It starts with our employees—whom we call Snoos—treating each other with respect through honoring our commitments 
and being kind, courteous, and professional to one another. Just as our users seek community to address needs around 
belonging, we cultivate that within our company via our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups represent Snoos 
who are veterans, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, of various abilities, women, and allies. We also host a range of less formal gatherings 
based on shared interests. Our Snoos often describe our work culture as fun, quirky, and a place where you can be your 
authentic self; this makes working at Reddit special and something that we believe to be a competitive advantage for us. To 
ensure that we continue to cultivate a strong workplace culture and make decisions that are best for our business, our users, and 
our Snoos, we have the following values to guide us:
•
Reddit’s Mission First—To achieve our mission, it is important to remember that we’re in this together. We move 
forward with this one shared goal above all others.
•
Make Something People Love—Our surest path to success is to make something people love.
•
Evolve—Only by continually improving and learning will we succeed.
•
Work Hard—Our mission is ambitious. It requires taking on and solving hard problems, and solving hard problems 
requires hard work. Nothing important is easy, and it is our firm belief that what we are working on is incredibly 
important. Each and every Snoo will have to give their best if Reddit is going to get to the next level.
•
Default Open—The free flow of ideas and feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy organization, and Reddit must 
embrace it if we are to thrive.
As of December 31, 2024, we had 2,233 employees, including 1,768 in the United States.

Any unauthorized control or manipulation of our products’ systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.
Our products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are
designed with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality.
While we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our
products and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to
modify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products’ functionality, user interface
and performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential
vulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported
and verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be
identified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.
Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or
government investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or
data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may
harm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.
Our business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.
It is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher
employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate
employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to
the relevant companies’ operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees,
they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time
to time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair
labor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”), and they may do so in the future. Any
unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees.
Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and
freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and
may harm our business and operating results.
We may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.
As a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles
have resulted from various hardware and software-related safety or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us
for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate
product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect
determination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls or field actions if any of
our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations,
such as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or provide certain functionalities. Such recalls or field actions, whether voluntary
or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant
expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and
operating results.
Our current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers. We also provide certain
warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance. For
components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties, but may",43
