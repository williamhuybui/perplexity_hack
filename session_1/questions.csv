•
Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership
•
Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt
•
Significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay 
for an acquisition
•
Assume liabilities
•
Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic 
impairment charges
•
Incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets
•
Incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure
•
Incur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses
•
Become subject to intellectual property or other litigation
Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, 
and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially harm our 
business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially 
harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful 
introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and 
marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition 
due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax 
rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks described with respect to new 
product development also apply to acquisitions.
Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our 
service and support operations.
As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity, we compete with 
companies of all sizes. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, 
than we do. Additionally, as customers complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, 
and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, 
or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and 
financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject 
us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer 
confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face 
increased legal and regulatory requirements.
Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.
We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. 
Software typically contains bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can unexpectedly interfere with its intended 
operations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software is installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-
shipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that 
could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross 
margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of 
defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product 
involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure of a product 
line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, product 
reengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.
Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region 
could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in 
part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers, 
component suppliers and distribution partners. Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in",54

We do this in service of 
delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today’s complex and unpredictable world.
Customer Priorities
Modernize Infrastructure
In an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, 
our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure, including through automation to manage and 
monitor each connection in real time.
We continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form an integrated 
architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that 
simplifies and helps secure networking for customers at scale.
Our Observability offerings collect and process daily measurements from customers’ owned and unowned networks, providing 
automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers to enable them to reduce 
mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT productivity and user experience.
For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless 
of where applications or data reside. We continue to make significant investments in the development of software, silicon and 
optics, which we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future.
As part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions to help them communicate 
more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration 
portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key 
component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.
Improve Cybersecurity
With the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, 
customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point 
solutions to a platform comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network; and 
harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk Inc. (“Splunk”) to prevent, 
detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.
Harness the Power of AI and Data
AI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher requirement for network 
connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and inference workloads for both webscalers and 
enterprises. We help to scale our customers’ network infrastructure with high-density routers and switches, improved network 
management, and high-performance optics. We are reinventing data center operations for our customers by simplifying the 
configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.
We can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their own business data. With this 
breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights and context to customers, leading them to more informed 
proactive decisions and better business results.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our Strategy and Priorities, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor 
entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, 
and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and 
market share may suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

2024-netflix-annual-report-10K.pdf,"Based on the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for Netflix, Inc., the key accounting policies related to content assets include the following:

- Netflix acquires, licenses, and produces content, including original programming, to offer unlimited video entertainment to its members. Content licenses are acquired for a fixed fee and specific availability windows, with some requiring more upfront cash payments than amortization expense[1].

- Content assets are recognized on the balance sheet as ""Content assets, net."" For licensed content, Netflix capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability when the license period begins, the cost is known, and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, costs such as development, direct production, and overhead are capitalized[1].

- The amortization of content assets is based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, amortized over the shorter of the contractual window or an estimated period of use up to ten years, starting from the first month of availability. This amortization is accelerated, reflecting expected higher upfront viewing, with film amortization faster than TV series. Over 90% of each content asset is typically amortized within four years[1].

- Tax incentives related to production spend are recognized as receivables if unpaid at launch and accounted for as reductions to the cost basis of content assets, thereby reducing content amortization over the asset's life[1].

- Since Netflix’s revenue model is subscription-based rather than tied to individual titles, content assets are reviewed in aggregate. If events indicate impairment or a reduction in expected usefulness, content assets would be recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value; however, no such impairment has been identified to date[1].

- Acquisitions involve assigning fair value to tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at acquisition, including uncertain tax positions and contingencies from the acquisition date[1].

- Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, using the straight-line method[1].

This approach reflects Netflix’s accounting for its content investments and related amortization during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. 

[1]",2024-netflix-annual-report-10K,data/2024-netflix-annual-report-10K.pdf,"The report is the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Netflix, Inc., covering the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.","Table of Contents
Short-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company
reviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the
security, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to
sell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.
Content
The Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video
entertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of
content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in
related liabilities, are classified within ""Net cash provided by operating activities"" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the
Company capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the
title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production,
including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.
Based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of
revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten
years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and
film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized
within four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The
Company's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.
In the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through
eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the
location the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s
service. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other
current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a
reduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as
presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and
produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates
a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such
event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or
fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.
Acquisitions
The Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection
with a business combination as of the acquisition date.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the",63

seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain 
liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will 
continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that 
are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for 
breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from 
product liability.
We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign 
jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for 
tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to 
tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. 
Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions 
are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, 
targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect 
sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result 
in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising 
and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader 
international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we 
operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.
Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or 
retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to 
provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government 
agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly 
comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.
Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, 
investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, 
losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or 
extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income 
and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the 
ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.
We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. 
Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash 
flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the 
inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, 
administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially 
different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to 
Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay 
additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the 
likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we",34

Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and 
taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special

tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or 
losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-
tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater 
when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is 
uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. 
We recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $7.1 billion and $9.3 billion in 2023 and 2024. See Item 8 of Part 
II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the 
conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign 
exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. 
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on 
the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales 
and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net 
cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by 
“Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance 
leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The 
following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most 
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report 
operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes 
that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure 
controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well 
conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system 
are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the 
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, 
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within 
NVIDIA have been detected.
Item 9B.  Other Information
On December 18, 2023, John O. Dabiri, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading arrangement that is 
intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale through December 2, 2024 of an 
estimated 553 shares of our common stock, assuming our closing stock price as of January 26, 2024. The number of 
shares is based on an estimate because the plan specifies a formulaic dollar amount of shares to be sold.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, 
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO 
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 4, 2025 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with 
the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

The U.S. has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could 
potentially increase in the future. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is 
coordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial 
changes to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on 
which various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our 
effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.
Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock 
We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active 
or fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could 
increase the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.
We engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with 
authorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and 
does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In 
April 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our 
Class A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board 
of Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and 
regulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our 
Board of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of 
Directors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors 
may depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity, 
financial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our 
share repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves 
and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. 
The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. 
Our Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has 
no voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our 
outstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common 
stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring 
stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or 
other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no 
voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based 
acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current 
relative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters 
submitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also 
affect Larry and Sergey’s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders’ 
ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, 
which could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. 
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that 
stockholders may consider favorable. 
Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a 
change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: 
•
Our Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of 
Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.
•
Our stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding 
a stockholders' meeting.
•
Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of 
minority stockholders to elect director candidates.

Grow Our International User Base. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, approximately 53% of 
Redditors visited the platform from outside of the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2024, over 
90% of all Reddit posts were made in English. We see a massive opportunity to grow in geographies outside of the 
United States and in languages beyond English. As of December 31, 2024, approximately one billion posts have been 
translated in various languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, and Filipino.

Why Advertisers Come to Reddit
Reddit is the place where people, entities of public interest, and businesses come together to engage in authentic human-to-
human conversations structured around their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in 
context about products and services, often with high purchase intent. We have made investments and acquisitions that have 
enabled us to be a leader in contextual and interest-based advertising. Advertisers of all sizes rely on Reddit to find highly 
engaged, high-intent customers in conversations that drive decisions at every stage of the path to purchase.
Advertisers come to Reddit for distinctive benefits:
•
Contextual and Interest-based Advertising. Reddit’s advertising platform enables marketers to find relevant audiences 
on the Reddit platform using our interest graph and to reach users in contextually relevant communities and 
conversations, using engaging and performant formats. For example, an advertiser with a camping product can reach 
people who love outdoor activities across Reddit. This is interest-based advertising. Similarly, the same advertiser can 
reach people who are in a conversation specifically about what to buy. A person exploring what gear they need in 
r/ camping or r/ Outdoors may see an ad for camping gear, in context, within that conversation. That is contextual 
advertising. Reddit’s unique community structure and interest-driven model acts as a strong signal for advertisers. 
•
Ability to Connect with a High-Intent Audience Seeking Recommendations on the Path to Purchase. Many people 
come to Reddit, directly or through search, to get recommendations and make purchase decisions. The conversations 
that happen on the platform play a strong role at every stage of the customer journey, assisting in discovery, 
consideration, validation, decision, and post-purchase. These conversations create a unique opportunity for advertisers 
to engage Redditors who are considering brands and products.. 
•
Authentic and Attentive Audience in an Attractive Demographic. In December 2024, the average active minutes on 
Reddit per logged-in user in the United States was between 25 and 30 minutes per day, and there was an average of 
101.7 million DAUq during the three months ended December 31, 2024. During this period, approximately 47% of 
DAUq were from the United States, and the remainder were from the rest of the world. 
•
Gain Access to a Platform with Data Signals that is Built to Respect Privacy. The performance of our advertising 
model is based on first-party data from user-directed activities on the platform, such as the communities that users visit 
or join and the content they are engaging in. The foundation of our ad performance is based on context and interest 
instead of tracking users based on personally identifiable information. This is unique in the digital advertising 
marketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other 
platforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem. 
•
Action-Oriented Outcomes that Drive Attractive, Measurable Return on Investment. Advertisers can bid in our 
auctions in a way that aligns with their business objectives. They can select from objectives across the full-funnel (e.g., 
impressions, traffic, conversions, install) to reach the audience most relevant for their desired goals. Our marketplace 
then optimizes to drive incremental value and efficiency for advertisers. 
•
Multiple Layers of Brand Safety and Customizable Controls. Beyond our multiple layers of moderation and safety 
across platform content, we also offer advertiser-level controls. Our Content Policy establishes the type of content that",11

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.77 billion,
$1.33 billion and $1.90 billion, respectively.
ESPP
Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible
compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and
last trading days of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under the ESPP we
issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million shares available
for issuance under the ESPP.
Fair Value Assumptions
We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the
fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing
fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury
notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common
stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
The following is a description of the rights of Common Stock and related provisions of the Company’s Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles”)
and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) and applicable California law. This description is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction
with, the Articles, Bylaws and applicable California law.
Authorized Capital Stock
The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 50,400,000,000 shares of Common Stock.
Common Stock
   Fully Paid and Nonassessable
   All of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock are fully paid and nonassessable.
Voting Rights
The holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted on by such holders. Holders of shares of Common
Stock are not entitled to cumulative voting rights.
Except as described below or as required by law, all matters to be voted on by shareholders must be approved by the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of
the shares present or represented by proxy and voting and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.
In an election of directors where the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, the candidates receiving the highest number

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for
the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of
examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately
$5 billion and $13 billion in the next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.
