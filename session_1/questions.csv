2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,"Based on the 2024 Amazon report discussing financial and operational performance and innovation culture:

How does Amazon's approach to innovation, as described in the 2024 report, emphasize collaboration, customer focus, and a startup mentality to drive the company's strong financial growth and key business achievements throughout its segments in 2024?",2024-amazon-annual-report-10K,data\2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,"This report is about Amazon and covers the company’s financial and operational results for the year 2024, highlighting strong revenue growth, improved operating income, and key business achievements across its segments[1][2][4].","hard questions about which customers will use this capability, what they’ll like most, what they’ll be most
disappointed with, why are we drawing the launch line where we are, why is it better than current alternatives,
how should we think about pricing, what pricing dimensions we recommend, and why have we made the
architectural decisions we have. The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and
how we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.
Be together whenever possible. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally,
a lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it’s
not how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then
a group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we’ve found that
this process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and
some cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn’t compare to being in the same
room. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way
ideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room—and yields
better outcomes for our customers and teams. With what’s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood
that every customer experience we’ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important
time, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.
Tolerating messy meetings. It’s hard to “schedule” innovation. You can’t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon
Prime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or
Project Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can’t change what’s possible for
customers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before
getting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we’re inventing, we accept
the process being beautifully imperfect.
Operate like a startup (in our case, the world’s largest startup). We strive to operate like the world’s largest
startup. What does that mean?
First, whatever we’re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or
meaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because
they’re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what’s possible for customers.
Second, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They’re people constantly
dissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can’t be better.
They’re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they’ve previously
built), and never feel like the job is done.
Third, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we’ve hired really
smart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our
teammates are constantly asking themselves, “What would I do if this was my own money?” “What would I
do if I started this company and I was the majority owner?” “Hey, I know I’ve only been asked to own a
part of this project, but I’m not sure if the other parts are being driven well—should I stick my nose into this
and make sure or just trust somebody’s got it?” Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the
quality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company’s mission as their mission (we want
missionaries, not mercenaries). That’s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors
versus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they
own the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable
for solving the Whys of their customer experiences.
Fourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It’s a false binary
to argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still
be high quality. We’ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision.
The leadership team has to believe it’s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural
barriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company
and culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in
which we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market
segments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking",4

2024-apple-annual-report-10K.pdf,"For Apple Inc. during the fiscal year ending September 28, 2024, what specific challenges does the company face in maintaining its competitive advantage in the global markets for smartphones, personal computers, and tablets?",2024-apple-annual-report-10K,data\2024-apple-annual-report-10K.pdf,"The report is about Apple Inc. and covers the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024.","Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be
unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward
pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in
product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and
businesses.
The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and
technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,
numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these
investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.
The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,
trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,
and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every
country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if
competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.
The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in
these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital
content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of
active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have
the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have
from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.
Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or
collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate
the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.
The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established
service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes
with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.
The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and
services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services
that compete effectively.
Business Risks
To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products
and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new
products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and
services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions
depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with",11

Further, growth of our software subscription offerings depends, in part, on the ability of 
customers to use and access these solutions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in service, 
storage failures, and other performance-related problems due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure and software 
changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints, unauthorized access, denial of service or other cyber attacks. In some 
instances, we may not be able to timely identify the cause or causes of these performance problems and, even if timely 
identified, we may be unable to timely remediate the underlying cause. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and 
improve our performance for our software subscription offerings, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions 
become more complex and our user traffic increases. Performance-related issues of our software subscription offerings may 
result in increased operational costs, delays in new feature rollouts, customer loss, reputational damage, and legal or regulatory 
liability, including liability under customer contracts or for losses suffered by our customers.
To deliver our software subscription offerings, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to implement and 
maintain this business. We make significant investments to increase or maintain capacity and to develop and implement new 
technologies in our infrastructure and operations, including those provided by third-party providers on which we rely. We may 
not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our 
operations to meet the needs of our customers and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, 
we may not be able to grow this business as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions, 
and we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, if our 
costs associated with our software subscription offerings were to significantly increase, our business, results of operations and 
financial condition may be negatively impacted. We are also subject to the risk of performance-related problems or interruption 
of the services provided by third-party providers on which we rely, which could cause revenues for software subscription 
offerings to decline, damage to our reputation, legal liability exposure, and/or increased expenses, all of which could negatively 
impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if 
we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and 
market share may suffer.
The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new 
product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on 
our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production 
costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.
The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology 
related to other market transitions— such as artificial intelligence, security, observability, and cloud— is complex and 
uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could 
be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to 
developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market 
will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking, security, or observability does not emerge as we believe 
it will, or these industries do not evolve as we believe they will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, 
many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products 
related to these markets in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on 
technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could 
be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings 
addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from",50

Description of 
the Matter
The Company is subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and 
investigations, other proceedings, and orders involving competition, intellectual property, data 
privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, 
content generated by its users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their 
platforms, personal injury, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial 
statements “Commitments and Contingencies” such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government 
inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and orders could result in adverse consequences.
Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a 
loss related to such matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss 
contingencies from these matters involved challenging and subjective auditor judgment in 
assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the estimated amount or 
range of loss.
How We 
Addressed the 
Matter in Our 
Audit
We tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for 
and disclosure of these matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the 
probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable 
and the development of related disclosures.
Our audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings and the status of 
ongoing lawsuits, reviewing letters from internal and external legal counsel addressing the matters, 
meeting with internal legal counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter 
from management on these matters. We also evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to 
these matters.

We measure recoverability of these assets by 
comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected 
to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is 
measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes 
payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of 
events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our 
deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax 
assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the 
global intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.
We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on 
technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the 
financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be 
realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to 
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.
Business Combinations
We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the 
purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, 
except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The 
excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
Foreign Currency
We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange 
rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, 
costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity. We 
reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to 
functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 
(ASU) 2023-09 ""Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures"" to expand the disclosure 
requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate 
reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes 
paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either 
prospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the 
effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 ""Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)"" to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses. Upon 
adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense 
categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 
2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be 
applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently assessing adoption timing and the effect that the 
updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.

of the date of the 2025 Meeting is first made by us, whichever is later.
Other Director Nominations and Proposals
Apart from Rule 14a-8 and the proxy access provision of our Bylaws, under our Bylaws certain procedures must be 
followed for a stockholder to nominate a director or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of 
stockholders.  If you wish to nominate a director or introduce an item of business at the 2025 Meeting that is not 
included in the proxy materials to be distributed by us in connection with our 2025 Meeting, you must do so in writing 
following the above instructions not later than the close of business on March 28, 2025, and not earlier than February 26,

public announcement of the date of the 2025 Meeting is first made by us, whichever is later.
Additional Requirements and Information
We also advise you to review our Bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder 
proposals, director nominations, and proxy access nominations.  We recognize the importance of the ability of our 
stockholders to nominate directors to our Board.  Accordingly, our Board will take into account feedback we receive from 
our stockholder engagement process regarding the process and disclosure requirements of our Bylaws for nominating 
directors and other proposals.  Our Board will engage with stockholders of various holdings size regarding any proposed 
amendments to our Bylaws that would require a nominating stockholder to disclose to us (i) such stockholder’s plans to 
nominate candidates to the board of directors of other public companies, or disclose prior director nominations or 
proposals that such stockholder privately submitted to other public companies or (ii) information about such 
stockholder’s limited partners or business associates beyond the existing requirements of our Bylaws.

suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop and 
deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural 
networks using our Data Center computing solutions, and then running a full perception, fusion, planning, and control 
stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. DRIVE Hyperion consists of the high-performance, 
energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware, a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well 
as an open, modular DRIVE software platform for autonomous driving, mapping, and parking services, and intelligent in-
vehicle experiences.
In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Sim, based on NVIDIA Omniverse 
software, for digital cockpit development, as well as for testing and validating a self-driving platform. Our unique end-to-
end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to 
receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.
Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex 
problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, 
it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that 
outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, and software 
layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to 
legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive. 
While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying 
architecture leveraging our GPUs, CUDA and networking technologies as the fundamental building blocks. The 
programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in research and development: we can 
support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks 
developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our 
target markets. 
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing 
platform for AI, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and 
networking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our compute solutions include all 
three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to 
add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. In addition, we offer DGX 
Cloud, an AI-training-as-a-service platform, and NeMo – a complete solution for building enterprise-ready Large Language 
Models, or LLMs, using open source and proprietary LLMs created by NVIDIA and third parties. Our AI technology 
leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing platforms are available 
from virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million 
developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We 
evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of startups through our Inception 
program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, 
and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform. 
Extending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused 
with AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development 
resources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and 
create new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming, design, and 
creative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized experience on our 
GeForce and NVIDIA RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-end, from the developer tools",115

We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based 
upon their market values as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends. 
Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of

We are in the early stages of monetizing our business, and there is no assurance we will be able to scale our business 
for future growth.
•
We generate a majority of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers, 
or the reduction of or failure by advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would adversely affect our 
business.
•
We may not succeed in further expanding and monetizing our platform internationally and may be subject to increased 
international business and economic risks.
•
We are exploring business opportunities in content licensing, but we are in the early stages and the market is new and 
evolving rapidly.
•
Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be harmed by our failure to timely and 
effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and infrastructure.
•
We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to data privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify 
instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.
•
If our security measures are breached, or if our products and services are subject to attacks involving our systems or 
data, some of which contain personal information, or that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and 
services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, Redditors and advertisers may curtail or stop using 
our products and services, and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be 
harmed.
•
Redditor growth and engagement depends upon effective interoperation with operating systems, networks, devices, 
web browsers, online application stores, regulations, and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those 
operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers, online application stores, regulations, or standards may harm Redditor 
retention, growth, and engagement, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.
•
Our business is subject to increasingly complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other 
legal obligations regarding content, consumer protection, competition, privacy, and other matters. Failure to comply with such 
laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other legal obligations could harm our business.
•
Interest in our Class A common stock from retail and other individual investors, for reasons unrelated to our 
underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals, could result in increased volatility in the market price of our Class A 
common stock.
•
The multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders 
who held our capital stock prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, including our directors, executive 
officers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates. This ownership will limit or preclude your ability to influence 
corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any major corporate 
transaction requiring stockholder approval, including change of control transactions.
•
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the governance agreement we entered into with our principal 
stockholder grant our principal stockholder certain rights with respect to the control and management of our business, which 
may prevent us from taking actions that may be beneficial to us and our other stockholders.
Risks Related to Our Business
We face intense competition, and if we fail to grow or retain our user base or maintain user engagement, our business, 
results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.
The size of our user base and their level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been, and 
will continue to be, significantly determined by our success in growing our user base so that we add Redditors, and those 
Redditors become more active users—more specifically, daily active uniques (“DAUq”). We define a user whom we can 
identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application 
at least once during a 24-hour period as a DAUq. DAUq is a user metric utilized by our management team. While it may be 
used to gauge usage of our platform, it may not correlate to revenue. We also measure weekly active uniques (“WAUq”) to help 
us understand the reach of our platform. We may not be successful in our strategies to convert monthly users or WAUq into 
more DAUq.

Secondary Sales
During the year ended December 31, 2023, certain former employees sold an aggregate of 183,677 shares of Class A 
common stock and 3,960,560 shares of Class B common stock to existing shareholders at purchase prices ranging from $25.00 
to $31.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $114.1 million. We estimated the fair value of the common stock 
purchased in the secondary sales based on several factors, including taking into account the amounts paid by third parties for 
our common stock. As the purchase price for the secondary sales paid by our existing shareholder was in excess of the fair 
value of such shares at the time of the transactions, we recognized immaterial stock-based compensation expense in connection 
with these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2023.

15. Employee Benefit Plans
We have a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for our United States-based employees. The 401(k) Plan is 
for all full-time employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible employees may contribute up to 100% of their 
annual compensation, but are limited to the maximum annual dollar amount allowable under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended (the “Code”). We match 100% of each participant’s contribution up to $3,000 and 25% of each participant’s 
contribution thereafter, subject to certain limitations and the IRS annual contribution limits. During the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized expense related to matching contributions of $11.5 million, $10.1 million, 
and $8.7 million, respectively.
