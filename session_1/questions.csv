2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,"How could challenges in hiring, retaining, and managing qualified personnel, as well as risks related to supplier relationships and commercial agreements, negatively impact Amazon’s business operations and results in 2024?",2024-amazon-annual-report-10K,data\2024-amazon-annual-report-10K.pdf,"This report is about Amazon and covers the company’s financial and operational results for the year 2024, highlighting significant revenue growth, improved operating income, and key business achievements across its segments[1][2][5].","significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical 
staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our 
employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our 
ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to 
successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.
We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry 
out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain 
our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and 
regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, 
decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our 
workforce.
We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational 
efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our 
response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of 
supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and 
content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, 
components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit 
or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, 
including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-
caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to 
procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we 
rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence 
infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our 
ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers 
or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain 
Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our 
reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks
We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through 
commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, 
technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services 
through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other 
resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, 
and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, 
inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third 
parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially 
dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the 
compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to 
enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject 
to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or",27

The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.
Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023 and $1.9
billion for 2022. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $13.8 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and
2022, respectively.
The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Noncash activities involving
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $1.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The weighted-average remaining lease term related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 10.3 years and
10.6 years, respectively. The discount rate related to the Company’s lease liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 3.1% and 3.0%,
respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the
discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
As of September 28, 2024, the Company had $849 million of fixed payment obligations under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space,
that had not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2025 and 2026, with lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 21 years.

2024-cisco-full-annual-report.pdf,"What are the key competitive challenges Cisco faced in 2024 due to market dynamics, changes in technology, and new entrants, and how did these factors impact its revenue growth and competitive positioning?",2024-cisco-full-annual-report,data\2024-cisco-full-annual-report.pdf,The report is about Cisco and covers the year 2024.,"The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could negatively impact our achievement of revenue 
growth.
The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking 
and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We 
compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product 
solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer 
product areas, and in key priority areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined 
networking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we have faced increased competition from companies that develop 
networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to 
purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service 
enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different 
geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from 
China, and we anticipate this will continue. For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” 
contained in “Item 1. Business” of this report.
Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product 
area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are 
regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering 
resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but
