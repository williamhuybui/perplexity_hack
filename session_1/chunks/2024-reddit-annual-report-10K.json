  "NOTE REGARDING USER METRICS AND OTHER DATA\nWe define a daily active unique (\u201cDAUq\u201d) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page \non the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period. We calculate \naverage DAUq for a particular period by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the \nnumber of days in that period. We define a weekly active unique (\u201cWAUq\u201d) as a user whom we can identify with a unique \nidentifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a \ntrailing seven-day period. We calculate average quarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on \neach day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We define average revenue per unique \n(\u201cARPU\u201d) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that geography. For the purposes of \ncalculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising \nimpressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is \nbased on the billing address of the customer. \nWe regularly review and continually seek to improve the accuracy of, and our ability to track, such metrics. While these \nmetrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent \nchallenges given the complexity of the systems involved and the rapidly changing nature of mobile devices and systems. \nTable of Contents\n5",
  "Part I\nItem 1. Business\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to empower communities and make their knowledge accessible to all.\nWe built Reddit with the belief that communities unlock the power of human creativity and create a sense of belonging and \nempowerment for their members. Our over 100,000 active communities have channeled the power of human creativity to grow \nReddit since our founding. We believe the world needs community more than ever, and that this represents our greatest \nopportunity to further enrich the lives of everyone in the world.\nOverview: The Power of Reddit\u2019s Communities\nReddit is a global, digital city where anyone in the world can join a community to learn from one another, engage in \nauthentic conversations, explore passions, research new hobbies, exchange goods and services, create new communities and \nexperiences, share a few laughs, and find belonging. People are diverse and have multiple interests. Just like in a city, where \ncitizens are part of multiple subcommunities, on Reddit, users often belong to multiple communities. At Reddit, users can dive \ninto anything, and if a community does not already exist around a particular topic, they can create one. In the three months \nended December 31, 2024, an average of 101.7 million daily active uniques (\u201cDAUq\u201d) around the world came together on \nReddit \u2013 continuously adding to our longstanding and constantly evolving human archive of information. They come together \nto share the rhythm of their daily discoveries, ask questions and receive advice, research before making a purchase decision, \nhear reactions to recent events, and thrive as a community. Built on shared interests, passion, and trust, Reddit has a community \nfor everyone.\nCommunities on Reddit are organized based on specific interests and are called subreddits. Within subreddits, Redditors \nengage in active and in-depth conversations by sharing experiences, submitting links, uploading images and videos, and \nreplying to one another in comment threads on any topic. Subreddits are denoted by an \u201cr/\u201d before their names: \nr/ explainlikeimfive helps people learn anything with child-friendly explanations; r/ lgbt helps people find their identity; and \nr/ BeyondTheBump helps people transition from pregnancy to parenthood. Redditors invest time to shape their communities, \nshare their experiences, send support and supplies when someone is down on their luck, and even code scripts and develop tools \nto advance their communities. \nSimilar to how cities are made from cement and steel, but are really built by their citizens, Reddit is made from code and \nalgorithms, but is really built by our users. It is a place where human ingenuity and creativity thrive. We empower users to \nparticipate and to shape Reddit by sharing content, upvoting or downvoting, and commenting. In addition, Redditors themselves \nnot only create and build communities, but they also moderate these communities as volunteers to help keep them safe, vibrant, \nand true to themselves. Like cities, we design tools that give communities what they need to make their communities their own \nand evolve over time, rebuilding and reshaping by adapting to new technologies and reflecting new cultural trends. Newly \ncreated subreddits create a sense of belonging for their members, spurring the creation of more new subreddits to continue the \ncycle. In this way, Reddit\u2019s community ecosystem grows and expands with the interests and passions of our users, keeping \nReddit on trend and resilient to fading fads.\nReddit\u2019s community ecosystem is organically built upon shared interests, passions, and trust rather than friends, celebrities, \nand their followers. This distinction results in a unique sense of belonging, privacy, and authenticity for our users. We do not \nrequire that users disclose their identities, freeing them from having to perform and the associated pressures to always appear \nperfect. As a result, users come to Reddit for fundamentally distinct purposes, with each adding incremental value to our entire \ncommunity. Redditors are free to be vulnerable or ask questions they would not be able to ask anywhere else. \nPowerful Platform Built Around Context and User Interest\nThese qualities not only make the experience more enjoyable for users, they also make Reddit a unique platform for \nadvertisers due to our intentional, authentic, trusted nature and our strength in contextual and interest-based advertising. For \nadvertisers, we provide access to a unique and highly engaged audience where our trusted, passionate communities drive \nrecommendations on brands and buying decisions. Whether users come to Reddit through a third-party search engine or if they \ninitiate their search on Reddit, our users often have high intent \u2013 they are looking for answers or recommendations that they can \ntrust, and these users can benefit from the conversations and contextual ads that are displayed on Reddit. \nTable of Contents\n6",
  "A Valuable Source of Conversational Data and Knowledge\nOver time, Reddit has evolved to become one of the internet\u2019s largest corpuses of information, with over two billion posts \nand over 20 billion comments through December 31, 2024, and an average of 1.2 million posts created daily and 9.7 million \ncomments created daily in December 2024. Our content is particularly important for artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) \u2013 it is a \nfoundational part of how many of the leading large language models (\u201cLLMs\u201d) have been trained. Furthermore, we use \ninternally built and trained models to improve many aspects of Reddit, including user onboarding, content translation, and \nmoderation and safety. Our massive corpus of conversational data and knowledge is what makes us unique, and we believe its \nvalue will continue to grow over time as our user-generated data continues to grow.\nEntrepreneurial User Economy\nWe are developing a user-powered economy on Reddit by providing our communities and creators with the requisite tools \nand incentives to drive continued creation and experiences. The Contributor Program enables people to earn money when other \nusers reward their posts or comments. We have also enabled the ability to pay for applications created in the Reddit \nDevelopment Platform. We believe these initiatives will open additional monetization channels for us.\nWhy Users Come to Reddit\nThe internet has given people the tools to redefine how we live. We have search engines to find content and social \nnetworks to share and follow each other. Our community of communities sets itself apart with its unique combination of \ncharacteristics and is designed to provide users with a trusted place to be authentic to themselves in sharing and discovering \nwhile maintaining their privacy. \nOpen, Growing Archive of Human Knowledge (2005\u2013     )\nOver the last 19 years, Reddit has become one of the internet\u2019s largest open archives of human experiences. With over two \nbillion posts and over 20 billion comments organized into communities, Reddit content provides authentic, human perspectives \nacross almost any topic imaginable. Our constantly updated user-generated content provides a vast collection of human \nexperiences, answers, and conversations and provides a source of fresh ideas. Reddit\u2019s influence and relevance organically \ngrows, and Reddit quickly responds to new topics based on real experiences. Topical communities such as r/ travel, \nr/ vanderpumprules, r/ MachineLearning, r/ cricket, r/ boxoffice, and r/ TaylorSwift have had meaningful breakouts as the \nheadlines have evolved. As a result of Reddit\u2019s scale and longevity, our content library is a broad memory of human interest, \norganically expanding and deepening into more topics. At times, Reddit may be the only place to find the information users are \nlooking for, and users searching for information often come to Reddit and discover conversations taking place there. \nCentered on Interests, with Unmatched Breadth and Depth of Human Knowledge\nTime spent on Reddit is guided by personal intention and interests. Breadth of communities and depth of engagement \nmeans that Redditors benefit from a trove of knowledge organized by topic that we believe is unmatched by any other internet \nplatform. Reddit is home to over 100,000 active subreddits, with over 500 subreddits that each have at least one million \nsubscribers, which cover a wide variety of topics\u2014r/ wholesomememes, r/ philosophy, r/ Cats, r/ InteriorDesign, r/ NBA, and \nr/ worldnews, to name a few\u2014and can be creative, humorous, informative, inspirational, absurd, serious, or contemplative. \nPeople-powered Curation for Authentic Interactions and Trusted Content\nOur differentiated community approach underlies the interactions on our platform: Reddit is centered around human \ncreativity and belonging. The content found in Reddit communities is curated by people, creating a highly relevant content \nexperience that attracts users to our platform. Every post and comment on Reddit, regardless of the author, starts with one \nupvote, and must earn its visibility through community members upvoting it and boosting it to the subreddit\u2019s front page. \nUnlike traditional social media, voting (both up and down) is completely anonymous, encouraging broader Redditor \nparticipation. This unique upvoting and downvoting system not only curates the quality and relevance of content, but also \ndetermines the prominence of a certain piece of content. We believe community-driven promotion of content leads to greater \ntrust of the content on Reddit.\nAuthentic and Trusted Recommendations\nReddit\u2019s community-powered recommendations are a foundational part of why so many users visit Reddit on a daily basis. \nIn a world where consumers are increasingly inundated with curated messaging and product placement, Reddit stands out as a \nrefreshing alternative, offering authentic human recommendations that people can actually trust.

  "Flexible Canvas for Self- and Community-expression\nEvery subreddit is a flexible canvas for communities to express themselves through a customizable experience. We give \ncommunities the ability to choose the format for conversations in their communities\u2014text, image, video, opinion polls, \nchatrooms\u2014which enables them to create dynamic and engaging experiences. We give moderators the creative tools to design \nthe look and feel of communities, and we give developers an open application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) to build bots and \ncreate features that shape their communities, meaning what a community envisions for itself drives its unique development.\nConversations flow across Reddit through cross-posting, where a post from one community can be shared into another \ncommunity to spur new conversation with a different audience. \nLayered Moderation, Community Management, and Safety Supports Trust\nWe are committed to continuously enhancing our policies and processes to promote the safety of users and moderators, and \nthe health of our platform. Our approach is akin to a democratic city, wherein everyone has the ability to vote and self-organize, \nfollow a set of common rules, and establish community-specific norms. This approach gives Redditors a voice and agency in \nthe process and also means that any content that gains traction on Reddit has been reviewed in context by humans. \nCommunities self-organize and create subreddit-level rules that are tailored to their unique circumstances, and volunteer \nmoderators within the community enforce those rules. Moderators have context as leaders and members of their communities to \ndefine and enforce the rules to create a harmonious community experience. The result is that each community has its own \nunique environment in which Redditors can express their genuine perspective and share real experiences while discouraging \nbad behavior. We backstop this bottoms-up organic moderation engine with our site-wide Content Policy, a set of overarching \nrules and policies that govern all content on Reddit. Our Content Policy is intended to be protective, not intrusive. It helps \nprotect against harassment, bullying, and violence \u2013 especially hate based on identity or vulnerability. \nOur Strategy for Growing Users and Engagement\nOur strategy is to support the growth and engagement of our communities. We aim to become Redditors\u2019 first choice when \nthey are exploring their passions, looking for entertainment, or keeping tabs on culture and news. We intend to grow users and \nengagement through the following initiatives:\n\u2022\nGrow Awareness and Engagement of Reddit. We plan to expand the ways people become aware of Reddit through \nvarious strategies depending on the type of use case and user, including search engine optimization and partnerships. \nWe have also invested in improving our off-platform presence, by making it easier to share and embed Reddit content \non other surfaces and websites. We had an average of 101.7 million DAUq and 379.4 million WAUq in the three \nmonths ended December 31, 2024. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to convert many of the users who \ncome to Reddit on a weekly or monthly basis to daily users. We plan to continue to grow engagement by focusing on:\n\u25e6\nImproving Discovery and User Experience. We want to make it easier for new and existing Redditors to discover \nrelevant communities and content. To that end, we are applying machine learning to improve the classification of \nour content and interest-based recommendations. For example, we are deploying internally built models to \nimprove the experiences of Redditors by increasing the likelihood that their posts will qualify for a particular \nsubreddit. In addition, we want the basic features of Reddit to be easier to use and more accessible, including \nposting into communities, finding and creating new communities, and moderating these communities. \n\u25e6\nCustomized Content Recommendations. We utilize AI to recommend relevant posts and communities, utilizing \nfactors such as search queries, post topics, and engagement with similar users to enhance both the search and \ndiscovery experience. We believe our investments in AI have improved new user onboarding and driven \nengagement with existing users. For example, we re-trained our New Home Feed ranking with significantly more \ndata and user signals. In the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended \nDecember 31, 2023, we observed an increase of 30% in \u201cGood Visits,\u201d defined as a user consuming a post for \nmore than 30 seconds.\n\u2022\nReinventing Search. While we are still in the early innings, search is already a key action taken on Reddit with an \naverage of over 40 million daily search queries directly on Reddit in December 2024. We recognize the importance of \nsearch, and have made investments to make searches more relevant and drive deeper engagement. In December 2024,",

We have seen people use Reddit Answers for a range of topics from planning trips to \nresearching the best products before making a purchase decision.\nTable of Contents\n8",
  "\u2022\nGrow Our International User Base. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, approximately 53% of \nRedditors visited the platform from outside of the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2024, over \n90% of all Reddit posts were made in English. We see a massive opportunity to grow in geographies outside of the \nUnited States and in languages beyond English. As of December 31, 2024, approximately one billion posts have been \ntranslated in various languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Dutch, and Filipino. \nWe are continuing to make more content available in many more languages, including Polish, Hindi, Bengali, Thai, \nMalaysian, and Vietnamese. Additionally, we are curating the Community Tab, Trending Today carousel, and sending \nhighly relevant push notifications to help international users find and engage regularly with locally relevant and \ntrending content. We have captured increased international momentum, with an average of 53.7 million international \nDAUq for the three months ended December 31, 2024, representing 46% growth year over year.\nWhy Advertisers Come to Reddit\nReddit is the place where people, entities of public interest, and businesses come together to engage in authentic human-to-\nhuman conversations structured around their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in \ncontext about products and services, often with high purchase intent. We have made investments and acquisitions that have \nenabled us to be a leader in contextual and interest-based advertising. Advertisers of all sizes rely on Reddit to find highly \nengaged, high-intent customers in conversations that drive decisions at every stage of the path to purchase.\nAdvertisers come to Reddit for distinctive benefits:\n\u2022\nContextual and Interest-based Advertising. Reddit\u2019s advertising platform enables marketers to find relevant audiences \non the Reddit platform using our interest graph and to reach users in contextually relevant communities and \nconversations, using engaging and performant formats. For example, an advertiser with a camping product can reach \npeople who love outdoor activities across Reddit. This is interest-based advertising. Similarly, the same advertiser can \nreach people who are in a conversation specifically about what to buy. A person exploring what gear they need in \nr/ camping or r/ Outdoors may see an ad for camping gear, in context, within that conversation. That is contextual \nadvertising. Reddit\u2019s unique community structure and interest-driven model acts as a strong signal for advertisers. \n\u2022\nAbility to Connect with a High-Intent Audience Seeking Recommendations on the Path to Purchase. Many people \ncome to Reddit, directly or through search, to get recommendations and make purchase decisions. The conversations \nthat happen on the platform play a strong role at every stage of the customer journey, assisting in discovery, \nconsideration, validation, decision, and post-purchase. These conversations create a unique opportunity for advertisers \nto engage Redditors who are considering brands and products.. \n\u2022\nAuthentic and Attentive Audience in an Attractive Demographic. In December 2024, the average active minutes on \nReddit per logged-in user in the United States was between 25 and 30 minutes per day, and there was an average of \n101.7 million DAUq during the three months ended December 31, 2024. During this period, approximately 47% of \nDAUq were from the United States, and the remainder were from the rest of the world. \n\u2022\nGain Access to a Platform with Data Signals that is Built to Respect Privacy. The performance of our advertising \nmodel is based on first-party data from user-directed activities on the platform, such as the communities that users visit \nor join and the content they are engaging in. The foundation of our ad performance is based on context and interest \ninstead of tracking users based on personally identifiable information. This is unique in the digital advertising \nmarketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other \nplatforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem. \n\u2022\nAction-Oriented Outcomes that Drive Attractive, Measurable Return on Investment. Advertisers can bid in our \nauctions in a way that aligns with their business objectives. They can select from objectives across the full-funnel (e.g., \nimpressions, traffic, conversions, install) to reach the audience most relevant for their desired goals. Our marketplace \nthen optimizes to drive incremental value and efficiency for advertisers. \n\u2022\nMultiple Layers of Brand Safety and Customizable Controls.

Beyond our multiple layers of moderation and safety \nacross platform content, we also offer advertiser-level controls. Our Content Policy establishes the type of content that \nis not allowed across all communities, with community rules determining content within each community. From there, \nour brand safety approach expands coverage by providing proactive solutions focused on creating a safe environment \nfor any business on Reddit by showing ads in communities and alongside content that has been reviewed and deemed \nappropriate for advertising. In addition, advertiser-level controls enable businesses to further customize their brand \nsafety preferences on Reddit. Advertiser controls include both 1P and 3P proactive capabilities. Our 3P proactive \nTable of Contents\n9",

In addition we provide post-campaign reporting through IAS and DV across \nbrand safety, viewability, and invalid traffic reporting.\nThe Future of Our Platform and Monetization Strategies\nAdvertising\nReddit is a unique place on the internet, and we believe that we have many avenues to increase value to advertisers through \nour interest- and community-based platform. We continue to expand our ad platform capabilities to enable more ways for \ncustomers to invest to grow their business on Reddit. We are still in the early phases of our opportunity and plan to pursue the \nfollowing eight levers to expand our monetization and average revenue per unique(1):\n1.\nMore Context and Interest. We plan to continue to add additional contextual and interest-based signals and intelligence \ninto our advertiser platform. We believe this will help advertisers find more relevant audiences on Reddit. This \nincludes existing placements in the home feed and in conversations, as well as potential future opportunities (e.g., ads \non search pages; video ads). \n2.\nDeliver ROI with Marketplace Optimizations. We are in the early stages of using machine learning and prediction \nmodels to better match supply and demand and deliver return on investment (\u201cROI\u201d) for our advertisers. We are \ncurrently focused on using our powerful prediction models to work across objectives, placements, and formats \u2013 \nhelping to better predict conversion rates of an ad (e.g., installs; purchases). \n3.\nAdvertiser Diversity and Depth. We plan to increase the types, sizes, and geographies of advertisers we reach and \nexpand annual partnerships for longer-term visibility. We aim to grow our advertisers from endemic advertisers in \nverticals where we have the largest number of active communities, like technology and communications; business, \nlegal, and finance; and media and entertainment, to newer verticals such as automotive; retail; consumer packaged \ngoods; pharmaceuticals; and food and beverage. We are focused on geographic markets where we have teams, channel \npartners, or vendors to help manage small- and mid-size businesses globally.\n4.\nDemonstrate ROI. By improving the measurement of our ads, we can provide better data to show our advertisers the \nROI of their presence on Reddit. We have invested in measurement capabilities that enable advertisers to better \nunderstand the impact of their Reddit campaign. This includes expanding Conversion API ecosystem to new partners, \nimproving Pixel implementation, investing in the foundation of on-platform conversion-lift, and on-platform brand lift.\n5.\nAI-Powered Audience Reach and Bidding. We are using machine learning models for contextual keyword audience \nreach and interest-based audience reach, ranking ads based on brand suitability and machine learning-predicted user \nengagement. Additionally, machine learning-powered \u201cauto-bidding\u201d (e.g., Maximum Clicks and Maximum \nConversions) helps advertisers maximize campaign objectives and ROI while avoiding extensive manual testing.\n6.\nExpanded Formats and Offerings. We plan to continue to develop new ad positions based on evolving consumer \nbehaviors on the platform (e.g., search usage growth). We plan to expand our ad formats in ways that allow advertisers \nto creatively talk to communities and share more information (e.g., product-level creative; AMAs). \n7.\nAutomation/Scale Service Model. Through easier onboarding, setup, campaign management, and optimization, we \nexpect to scale our service model through diverse service channels matched to client needs \u2013 from managed service \nmodels, to hybrid, to enabling advertisers to activate with little to no sales team assistance (i.e., unmanaged). This \nsimplifies core manual optimization tasks needed for more outcomes and better performance.\n8.\nAcquire More Advertisers. With more automation in the future, we believe that we can become even more accessible \nto a larger portion of small- and medium-sized businesses enabled by partnerships and accelerated demand generation. \nWe are also deepening our relationships with large agencies through solutions that enable enterprise operations across \nlarge clients. \nContent Licensing\nReddit is one of the internet\u2019s largest corpuses of authentic and constantly updated human-generated conversations, \ncommunity, and content. In an increasingly data-driven world, we recognize that this information is increasingly important for a \nmultitude of different uses and applications. We believe the internet should work for consumers and they should be able to find \nthe information they need or experiences they want. And, organizations need to prioritize sources of real-time human \nTable of Contents\n10\n(1)\nAverage revenue per unique (\u201cARPU\u201d) is defined as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that \ngeography",
  "perspectives\u2014from a company looking for feedback on a new consumer product to investors trying to capture market \nsentiments or signals\u2014and Reddit provides a differentiated solution. Reddit data and information constantly grows and \nregenerates as users come and interact with their communities and each other in genuine and authentic ways. We expect our \ngrowing data advantage to continue to be valuable across several applications of LLMs (e.g., search, run-time inference). We \ncontinue to strategically explore content licensing agreements with collaborative partners in the ecosystem ranging from \nmarketing intelligence companies to enterprise-scale technology companies. We are also exploring go-to-market strategies for \nnew verticals, including the financial services industry.\nUser Economy\nCommerce has already emerged on our platform organically as a result of our interest-and community-based approach. \nArtisans sell their creations, collectors sell beloved items, and developers sell entertainment via originally developed video \ngames. This activity has been taking place in communities dedicated to creativity, memorabilia, and fandoms for many years. \nWe intend to support the Reddit user economy by providing our users and creators with the requisite tools and incentives to \ndrive continued creation, improvements, and commerce. In turn, we believe this will open additional monetization channels for \nReddit:\n1.\nDeveloper Platform. We are providing developers with additional tools and increased monetization opportunities to \nunlock creativity on Reddit and incentivize continued improvements to the overall user experience and utility of the \nplatform.\n2.\nContributor Program. As creators, builders, and developers generate value on our platform, we intend to empower \nthese groups to participate in their value creation by receiving monetary benefits from Reddit and other community \nmembers. Increasingly, talented individuals are turning to online communities to share their creations with fans, peer \ncreators, and enthusiasts. We are focused on increasing the types of ways that users can recognize contributors with \nreal-world money to incentivize and reward quality content creation.\n3.\nCommunity Experiences. We have a Collectible Avatars Creator Program, which empowers users to create, own, and \nmonetize their artistic creations, and for which we receive a portion of the primary sales and royalty fees. We are also \nexploring ways to enable communities to offer subscriptions to premium experiences and engage with other paying \nmembers.\nCompetition\nWe are competing for people\u2019s time and for global advertising spend. As such, we face significant competition across many \nareas of our business. People may choose to spend their time using other products when looking to fulfill the needs Reddit \nprovides, such as being entertained, seeking information, diving into current events, exploring passions and hobbies, or peer-to-\npeer commerce. Examples of select competitors across several time spent categories include:\n\u2022\nFor Seeking Information\u2014Google, Amazon, YouTube, Wikipedia, X, and other news sites. Some users are also \nturning to LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Anthropic.\n\u2022\nFor Entertainment\u2014Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), YouTube, Snap, X, TikTok, \nRoblox, and Twitch.\n\u2022\nFor Passions and Hobbies\u2014Facebook Groups, Discord, X, and Pinterest.\n\u2022\nFor Peer-to-peer Commerce and User Economy\u2014Facebook Marketplace, Nextdoor, Craigslist, Poshmark, Etsy, and \nRoblox.\nAdvertisers can also reach consumers via many other digital advertising platforms and channels. We compete directly with \nall other major advertising platforms as well as publishers including: Google, Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and X. To \ncompete effectively, we will need to enable advertisers to identify the audiences they wish to reach effectively and be able to \naccurately show the value of their investment. In addition, our content licensing offerings face competition from other sources \nof information, including news, publishing, entertainment, and social media.\nSeasonality in Our Business\nWe have historically seen seasonality in our business and financial results, with an increase in overall advertiser spending \nin the fourth quarter, due in large part to end-of-year advertiser spending, typically followed by a weaker first quarter.\nTable of Contents\n11",

It starts with our employees\u2014whom we call Snoos\u2014treating each other with respect through honoring our commitments \nand being kind, courteous, and professional to one another. Just as our users seek community to address needs around \nbelonging, we cultivate that within our company via our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups represent Snoos \nwho are veterans, BIPOC, LGBTQ+, of various abilities, women, and allies. We also host a range of less formal gatherings \nbased on shared interests. Our Snoos often describe our work culture as fun, quirky, and a place where you can be your \nauthentic self; this makes working at Reddit special and something that we believe to be a competitive advantage for us. To \nensure that we continue to cultivate a strong workplace culture and make decisions that are best for our business, our users, and \nour Snoos, we have the following values to guide us:\n\u2022\nReddit\u2019s Mission First\u2014To achieve our mission, it is important to remember that we\u2019re in this together. We move \nforward with this one shared goal above all others.\n\u2022\nMake Something People Love\u2014Our surest path to success is to make something people love.\n\u2022\nEvolve\u2014Only by continually improving and learning will we succeed.\n\u2022\nWork Hard\u2014Our mission is ambitious. It requires taking on and solving hard problems, and solving hard problems \nrequires hard work. Nothing important is easy, and it is our firm belief that what we are working on is incredibly \nimportant. Each and every Snoo will have to give their best if Reddit is going to get to the next level.\n\u2022\nDefault Open\u2014The free flow of ideas and feedback is the lifeblood of a healthy organization, and Reddit must \nembrace it if we are to thrive.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 2,233 employees, including 1,768 in the United States.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2011.

Our financial performance has been, and \nwill continue to be, significantly determined by our success in growing our user base so that we add Redditors, and those \nRedditors become more active users\u2014more specifically, daily active uniques (\u201cDAUq\u201d). We define a user whom we can \nidentify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application \nat least once during a 24-hour period as a DAUq. DAUq is a user metric utilized by our management team. While it may be \nused to gauge usage of our platform, it may not correlate to revenue. We also measure weekly active uniques (\u201cWAUq\u201d) to help \nus understand the reach of our platform. We may not be successful in our strategies to convert monthly users or WAUq into \nmore DAUq.\nTable of Contents\n14",
  "The absolute number of our DAUq and our DAUq growth rate has decreased in the past and may fluctuate or decrease in \none or more markets from time to time due to various factors, especially after periods of high growth, such as we have \nexperienced. For example, although we saw increased growth in our user base during the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced \nlower levels of DAUq growth and declining DAUq as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided. DAUq has also \ndeclined in the past in periods following usage peaks surrounding certain worldwide events, such as the onset of the conflict \nbetween Russia and Ukraine in the three months ended March 31, 2022, and cultural trends, including video game releases, \nsuch as Elden Ring in the three months ended March 31, 2022, and traffic related to r/ wallstreetbets in the three months ended \nMarch 31, 2021. These usage peaks are driven by external factors that are outside of our control. Accordingly, such growth may \nnot be repeatable and we may experience declines in DAUq in the future in similar circumstances. DAUq has also been volatile \nduring community responses to domestic and international social unrest as well as in response to actions by us. For example, we \nsaw increased growth in our user base in the three months ended December 31, 2023, which may have been driven in part by \nperformance improvements in our product and possibly by migration of usage from certain third-party applications in response \nto changes in our application program interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) terms and policies. Such growth may not be sustainable. In the three \nmonths ended December 31, 2024, logged-out DAUq comprised 55% of global DAUq. Logged-out users typically come to \nReddit via search engines, spend less time on the site, and do not monetize at the same rate as logged-in users. Furthermore, we \nanticipate that our DAUq growth rate will slow over time as the absolute number of our DAUq increases. To the extent our \nDAUq growth rate slows or becomes negative, our success will increasingly depend on our ability to increase levels of \nengagement and monetization on our platform, including the level at which users visiting us from search traffic become more \nfrequent users of our platform. \nA number of factors could harm Redditor growth and engagement or impact our ability to compete effectively, including if:\n\u2022\nRedditors engage with other products, services, or activities as an alternative to ours;\n\u2022\nour competitors incorporate features into their products that are substantially similar to ours or improve upon such \nfeatures when including them in their products;\n\u2022\nwe fail to introduce new and improved products or services or we introduce new or improved products or services that \nnegatively affect Redditor engagement;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to convert DAUq who come to our platform through internet search engines to sign-up and log in;\n\u2022\nRedditors feel that their Reddit experience is diminished as a result of our decisions with respect to the frequency, \nprominence, and size of ads that we display, or the quality of the ads displayed;\n\u2022\ninfluential Redditors or certain demographics of Redditors conclude that an alternative product or service better meets \ntheir needs;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to convince new Redditors of the value and usefulness of our products and services;\n\u2022\ntechnical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products or services in a rapid and reliable manner or \notherwise negatively affect Redditors\u2019 experience with our platform;\n\u2022\nwe fail to effectively adopt new technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), that our \ncompetitors may have more experience utilizing and leveraging in their products and services; \n\u2022\nRedditors have difficulty installing, updating, searching, or otherwise accessing our products and content or prefer to \nutilize third-party applications that have shut down or no longer integrate with our platform;\n\u2022\nthere are disruptions to the normal operation of our communities, including as a result of actions or inactions by our \nvolunteer moderators;\n\u2022\nRedditors are unable to locate content that is interesting, useful, relevant, reliable, high-quality, or trustworthy to them, \nor otherwise find content available on our platform offensive, inappropriate, hostile, or otherwise objectionable;\n\u2022\nthere are Redditor concerns related to privacy and communication, safety, security, or other factors or changes to our \nplatform or policies are not well received by Redditors;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to combat harmful or inappropriate usage of our platform;\n\u2022\nthere are adverse changes in our products or services that are mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, \nlegislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements;\nTable of Contents\n15",

We compete against \nmany companies that provide content and communications services to online users, including Google, Meta (including \nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), YouTube, Wikipedia, Snap, X, Pinterest, TikTok, Roblox, Discord, and \nTwitch, and which offer a variety of internet- and mobile device-based products, services, and content. Many of these \ncompanies have greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases than Reddit. Furthermore, as we pursue \nopportunities to empower our user economy, we expect to face competition from existing online marketplaces, including \nPatreon, Substack, and Squarespace. As a result, our competitors may draw users towards their products or services and away \nfrom ours. This could decrease the growth or engagement of Redditors, which, in turn, would negatively affect our business. In \naddition, we face competition from large language models (\u201cLLMs\u201d), such as those built by Google, Meta, OpenAI, and \nAnthropic; Redditors may choose to find information using LLMs, which in some cases may have been trained using Reddit \ncontent, instead of visiting Reddit directly.\nWe believe that sustained meaningful active Redditor growth is dependent on improving our products and services to \ndemonstrate our value proposition to a larger audience and penetrating additional demographics, which we believe may take a \nconsiderable amount of time. If we are unable to increase our DAUq, or its growth rate, or if this metric declines, our products \nand services could be less attractive to potential new users, as well as to advertisers, which would harm our business, results of \noperations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIf Redditors do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not valuable or appealing to other Redditors, we \nmay experience a decline in the number of Redditors accessing our products and services and in user engagement, which \ncould result in the loss of advertisers and may harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and \nprospects.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide users of our products and services with valuable content, which in turn \ndepends on the content contributed by Redditors. We seek to foster a broad and engaged Redditor community. If Redditors do \nnot continue to contribute content and otherwise engage with our platform, and we are unable to provide Redditors with \nvaluable and timely content, our user base and their engagement may decline. A large portion of the content on our platform \ncomes from a small number of Redditors contributing to communities (which are also known as subreddits). If prolific \nRedditors do not continue to contribute content and otherwise engage with our platform, or decide to leave our platform and \nencourage other Redditors to follow them to a new platform, our user base and their engagement may decline. Our platform \nmay also be used by third parties to disseminate abusive or other harmful content in violation of our terms and applicable law. \nWe may not proactively discover or quickly respond to such content once alerted to it due to our scale and the limitations of \nexisting technology and operational infrastructure. If we are unable to successfully prevent or detect and timely address abusive \nor other harmful behavior on our platform, our user base and their engagement may decline. Additionally, in keeping with our \nmission to empower communities and make their knowledge accessible to all, our site-wide content policy is designed to be \nprotective, but not intrusive. If Redditors perceive the content available on Reddit to be offensive, inappropriate, hostile, or \notherwise objectionable, we may experience a decline in user activity generally, or among certain demographics. We generate a \nmajority of our revenue from the sale of advertising services. If we experience a decline in the number of Redditors, or a \ndecrease in Redditor growth rate or engagement, including as a result of lack of valuable or appealing content, or the loss of \ninfluential Redditors or subreddits, advertisers may not view our products and services as attractive for their marketing \nexpenditures, and may reduce their spending with us, which would harm our reputation, business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and reputation, and if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand and \nreputation, our ability to expand our user and advertiser bases will be impaired and our business, results of operations,",

We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the \u201cReddit\u201d brand and \nreputation is critical to retaining and growing our user and advertiser bases. We anticipate that maintaining and enhancing our \nbrand and reputation will depend largely on our continued ability to provide high-quality, relevant, reliable, trustworthy, and \ninnovative products, which may require substantial investment and may not be successful. We may need to introduce new \nproducts or updates to existing products that require Redditors to agree to new terms of service that Redditors do not like, which \nmay negatively affect our brand and reputation. Additionally, advertisements or actions of our advertisers may affect our brand \nTable of Contents\n16",
  "and reputation if Redditors do not think the advertisements help them accomplish their objectives, view the advertisements as \nintrusive, annoying, or misleading, or have poor experiences with our advertisers.\nOur brand and reputation may also be negatively affected by the content or actions of Redditors that are deemed to be \noffensive, inappropriate, hostile, or otherwise objectionable to other Redditors, by the actions of Redditors acting under false or \ninauthentic pretenses, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading, or by \nthe use of our service for illicit, illegal, or objectionable ends. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or at all to the sharing \nof illegal, illicit, offensive, inappropriate, hostile, or otherwise objectionable content on our platform or to objectionable \npractices by advertisers, or to otherwise address Redditors\u2019 concerns, which could erode confidence in our brand and damage \nour reputation. We expect that our ability to identify and respond to such content in a timely manner may decrease as the \nnumber of Redditors grows, as the amount of content on our platform increases, or as we expand our product and service \nofferings, such as an increase in video content. Any governmental or regulatory inquiry, investigation, or action, including \nbased on the appearance of illegal, illicit, or objectionable content on our platform or the failure to comply with applicable laws, \nrules, and regulations, could damage our brand and reputation, regardless of the outcome.\nWe receive a high degree of media coverage globally. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, media, \nlegislative, governmental, and regulatory scrutiny of our decisions. Unfavorable publicity and scrutiny involving us, including \nregarding our data privacy, intellectual property, content, or other practices, product changes, product quality, pricing increases, \nlitigation, or regulatory action, or regarding the actions of our employees, Redditors, moderators, or advertisers, or other issues, \nmay significantly harm our brand and reputation, and could adversely affect the size, demographics, engagement, and loyalty of \nour user base. For instance, in May and June 2023, we experienced negative publicity as a result of our API policy changes. In \naddition, unfavorable publicity and scrutiny of other companies in our industry, including controversies surrounding their \nproduct design choices, content-related decisions, or their data privacy practices, could also have a negative impact on our \nbrand and reputation. These concerns, whether actual or unfounded, may also deter Redditors or advertisers from using our \nservice.\nIn addition, we may fail to adequately address the needs of Redditors or our advertisers, which could erode confidence in \nour brand and damage our reputation. If we fail to promote and maintain the \u201cReddit\u201d brand or preserve our reputation, or if we \nincur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be harmed.\nChanges in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics could have a negative impact on traffic for our website and, \nultimately, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nOur success depends partly on our ability to attract online visitors to our website. We rely, in part, on internet search \nengines, such as Google, to generate traffic to our website, primarily through free or organic searches. Search engines \nfrequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of the results of a user\u2019s search, such that the \npurchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites may be ranked lower in the search results or otherwise less visible \nin a user\u2019s search. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results, \ncausing our website to place lower in organic search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner \nthat negatively affects the search engine ranking of our website or those of our partners, our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate, and our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes them \ndifficult to predict.\nAlthough we had net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2024, we have previously \nincurred net losses since our inception, and we may incur net losses in the future.

We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in \nfuture periods, and if our revenue growth does not increase to more than offset these anticipated increases in our costs and \nexpenses, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects will be harmed, and we may not be able to \nmaintain profitability. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make \nsignificant investments to broaden our user base, develop and implement new products, market new and existing products and \npromote our brand, expand our technical infrastructure, and hire additional employees (with a related expected increase in \npayroll and stock-based compensation expense). Some of these investments may generate only limited revenue and reduce our \noperating margin. If our investments are not successful, our ability to increase revenue may be adversely affected. \nIn addition, our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future, based on the \nseasonality of our business as well as external factors impacting the global economy.

Our \ngrowth strategy depends on, among other things, attracting more advertisers, scaling our business with existing advertisers, and \nexpanding our advertising services, as well as successfully identifying and capturing non-advertising sources of revenue. There \nis no assurance that this revenue model will be successful or that we will generate increased revenue. \nTo sustain or increase our advertising revenue, we must attract new advertisers, encourage existing advertisers to maintain \nor increase their advertising spend on our platform, expand the number of markets where we offer advertising, and increase the \nbreadth and functionality of our advertising services, including new advertising formats and measurement tools. In order to \nobtain new advertisers and further our relationship with current advertisers, we must increase the amount of monetizable \ncontent on our platform, including by increasing the absolute number of DAUq who post and consume content, and our \nmonetization model depends on this engagement. Not all DAUq monetize in the same manner or rate, so we also measure the \naverage revenue per unique (\u201cARPU\u201d) to help us understand the extent to which we are monetizing DAUq. Much of our DAUq \ngrowth to date has come from certain users, such as logged-out users or users located outside the United States, who may \nrepresent lower monetization opportunities. There is no assurance that our user growth or engagement strategy will continue to \nbe successful or that we will increase the number of DAUq, ARPU, or the amount of monetizable content on our platform. \nTable of Contents\n18",
  "Without such growth, we could see our supply of monetizable inventory stay constant or decrease, which may limit or hinder \nour ability to increase revenue.\nAs we continue to grow our advertiser base, our revenue depends on our ability to effectively serve enough advertisements \nthat meet the objectives of our advertisers while maintaining a high-quality, relevant, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative user \nexperience. If we are unable to do this on our platform due to either a decline in DAUq, or changes in our products or services \nor Redditor behavior that reduce our ability to display as many advertisements as our advertisers may request, our business, \nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely affected. Our advertising business can be inventory \nconstrained at times, and the attendant impact on the supply and pricing of our advertising inventory could affect the financial \nperformance of our business. We could find ourselves unable to match customer advertising specifications with available \ninventory, leaving us unable to deliver the advertising inventory requested and receiving less revenue than otherwise expected. \nThis also could put upward pressure on advertising prices and potentially impact the return advertisers get on their spend, which \nin turn could affect future advertiser spending. To scale the growth of our advertising services, we will have to successfully \ndevelop and target ad products tailored to the interests of our advertising customers and our user base, which may require \nadditional user data. If we are unable to do this with the data, technology, and resources available to us, we may need to rely \nmore heavily on alternative revenue sources to grow our business.\nWe will continue to identify and develop potential new revenue streams. We have explored and continue to explore \ndifferent ways for Redditors to make money on Reddit, including Reddit\u2019s earnings programs for contributors, developers, and \ncreators, while also providing a source of revenue for Reddit as well. We also continue to explore reasonable content licensing \nopportunities as another possible source of revenue where those opportunities do not conflict with our values and the rights of \nour Redditors and have only recently generated revenue from this opportunity. There are many aspects of these possible \nrevenue sources which are novel and untested, which makes it challenging to evaluate the viability of any future revenue \nopportunities or to identify the risks and challenges we may encounter in seeking to execute on our strategies. There can be no \nassurance that we will be successful in generating meaningful revenue from any of these non-advertising sources. If we are \nunable to succeed in these monetization efforts or identify new revenue opportunities, our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects could be harmed. \nIn addition, we plan to continue expanding our business operations outside the United States and offering content and \nadvertising to Redditors and advertisers in other languages and countries. We plan to continue to enter new international \nmarkets where we have limited or no experience in deploying our services or selling advertisements. In order to expand \nsuccessfully, we need to offer content and products that are tailored to the interests of local Redditors and the needs of local \nadvertisers, each of which requires significant investment of time and resources. As we expand into new international markets, \nwe may not yet understand the full scope of prospective users\u2019 interests, demographics, and culture, or advertiser expectations, \ntarget audiences, and return on advertising spend, in those markets. This may cause us to expand into markets before we are \nable to offer a service and advertising platform that has been sufficiently localized for those markets or where those markets \nlack the necessary demand and infrastructure for long-term adoption of our services. If we are unsuccessful in deploying, \nscaling, or managing our operations in international markets, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and \nprospects could be adversely affected.\nWe generate a majority of our revenue from advertising. We face intense competition for advertising spend both inside and \noutside the United States, and we are subject to a rapidly evolving technology landscape. If we fail to attract or retain \nadvertisers, or advertisers do not maintain or increase their advertising budgets, our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected. \nA majority of our revenue is generated from third parties advertising on our platform.

The volatility of advertiser spending, particularly in response to economic uncertainty, could exacerbate these risks, \nmaking it difficult for us to predict future performance or ensure consistent growth. The occurrence of any of these or other \nfactors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, either of which \nwould negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Additionally, our international \nexpansion introduces additional risks, such as operational challenges and regulatory compliance, which could further harm our \nrevenue growth and results of operations. \nIf we do not develop successful new products and services or improve existing products and services, our business will \nsuffer.\nOur ability to retain, increase, and engage Redditors and increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to \nevolve our existing products and services and to create successful new products and services. We have invested, and expect to \ncontinue to invest, in improvements to our platform, significant changes to our existing products and services, new and \nunproven products and services, including machine learning and AI, and other initiatives to generate revenue and increase our \nuser base and user engagement. For example, with Reddit\u2019s Contributor Program, we allow users to earn money from their \nReddit contributions to the platform and other Redditors.\nImprovements to our platform, new products and services, and other initiatives may be costly, difficult to operate, and \ncould divert management\u2019s attention, and there is no guarantee that they will be positively received by Redditors or provide \npositive returns on our investment. For example, new ad formats, such as video ads, may be more engaging, and Redditors may \nconsequently spend less time browsing or searching on our platform, which could adversely affect our revenue. Further, new \nproducts or services that we develop may, in certain cases, require regulatory approval prior to launch, result in increased \nlitigation, or subject us to new or enhanced governmental or regulatory requirements or scrutiny. There is no guarantee that we \nwill be able to obtain any required regulatory approval, and our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be \ncostly and divert management\u2019s time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. These new products and updates may \nalso fail to increase the engagement of Redditors and our advertisers or partners, and may even result in short- or long-term \ndecreases in such engagement by disrupting existing Redditor, advertiser, or partner behavior or by introducing performance \nand quality issues. In addition, in some cases, we may have little or no prior experience related to developing the technologies \nunderlying the new products and services. If our new or enhanced products or services fail to engage, or meet the expectations \nof, Redditors or our advertisers or developers, or if our business plans or new approaches to monetization are unsuccessful, we \nmay fail to attract new users, retain existing Redditors, or generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify \nour investments, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be harmed. \nOur business relies on an approach to content moderation that, while empowering community-led authenticity, can also \nresult in content on the platform that can be unrelatable, offensive, and that may pose inherent risks.\nOur business relies on a layered approach to content moderation.

Our \nbusiness relies on moderators to engage in good faith and to manage their subreddits in a manner that meets the needs of the \nsubreddit\u2019s members. Our approach to content moderation depends on the activities of the moderators to protect the experiences \nof the members of their communities. Our approach requires that moderators be sufficiently active in their moderation \nactivities, depending on the size and scale of their communities. For the larger communities, the need for moderators can be \nsignificant, requiring ever-increasing numbers of moderators willing to volunteer their time to effectively scale with the size of \nthe community. In addition, the enforcement demands placed on moderators can increase dramatically on short notice if traffic \nTable of Contents\n21",
  "to a particular subreddit increases due to current events or trends, for example, r/ wallstreetbets, or if a community is subject to \ncoordinated spam or abuse campaigns, despite the availability of tools and the efforts of our employees who oversee and \nenforce site-wide rules. As communities grow, it can become more and more challenging for communities to find qualified \npeople willing to act as moderators.\nMoreover, moderators within a community may disagree on the vision for, or direction of, the community, or may simply \ndecide not to work together, resulting in a degraded community experience and subreddit disruption, instability, stagnation, or \neven dissolution. Moderators, even when acting in good faith, may have different values or viewpoints than what others view as \nsocially acceptable or, worse, may be bad actors against whom we need to enforce our rules.\nWhile we provide tools to our communities to manage their subreddits, our moderators also rely on their own and third-\nparty tools. Any disruption to, or lack of availability of, these third-party tools could harm our moderators\u2019 ability to review \ncontent and enforce community rules. Further, if we are unable to provide effective support for third-party moderation tools, \ndevelop our own such tools, or otherwise change what tools are available to moderators, our moderators could decide to leave \nour platform and may encourage their communities to follow them to a new platform, which would adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nBecause moderators are volunteers, any moderator can decide to stop acting as a moderator and participate only as a \ncommunity member, or to leave our platform entirely. Certain moderators, especially those who moderate large communities or \na large number of communities, may be able to leverage their influence within those communities to change the dynamics of the \ndiscourse within the communities or to disrupt the normal operation of their communities or other communities on our \nplatform. Moderators can also band together and, for various reasons, including changes to Reddit\u2019s product or policies, decide \nto shut down the normal operation of their communities in a manner that degrades the experiences of all Redditors in the \naffected communities and that can negatively impact Redditors who continue to use our service and reduce the amount of \nmonetizable content generated by Redditors. For example, in response to certain changes to our API policies in June 2023, \nmoderators of certain communities inhibited normal operations of the communities they operate, in many cases in violation of \nour site-wide rules. While these activities have not historically had a material impact on our business or results of operations, \nsimilar actions by moderators and/or their communities in the future could adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on the development and availability of tools to accurately measure the effectiveness \nof advertisements on our platform.\nMost advertisers rely on tools that measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns or that verify viewability of their ads on \nour platform in order to allocate their advertising spend among various formats and platforms. If we are unable to measure the \neffectiveness of advertising on our platform or we are unable to convince advertisers that our platform should be part of a larger \nadvertising budget, our ability to increase the demand and pricing of our advertising products and maintain or scale our \nadvertising revenue will be limited. Our tools may be less developed than those of other platforms with which we compete for \nadvertising spend, in particular relative to those platforms that collect more personal information than we do. Therefore, our \nability to develop and offer tools that accurately measure the effectiveness of a campaign or verify ad viewability on our \nplatform will be critical to our ability to attract new advertisers and retain, and increase spend from, our existing advertisers.\nDeveloping and improving these tools may require significant time and resources and additional investment, and in some \ncases we rely on third parties to provide data and technology needed to provide certain measurement or verification data to our \nadvertisers. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising tools in a timely fashion, those tools are not reliable, \ndifficult to use, or otherwise unsatisfactory to our advertisers, or the measurement or verification results are inconsistent with \nadvertiser goals, our advertising revenue could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, web and mobile browser developers, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google, have implemented, and may \ncontinue to implement, changes in their browser or device operating systems that impair our ability to measure traffic in general",
  "difficult to use, or otherwise unsatisfactory to our advertisers, or the measurement or verification results are inconsistent with \nadvertiser goals, our advertising revenue could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, web and mobile browser developers, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google, have implemented, and may \ncontinue to implement, changes in their browser or device operating systems that impair our ability to measure traffic in general \nand, in particular, the effectiveness of advertising on our platform. Such changes include limiting the use of first-party and \nthird-party cookies, such as Apple\u2019s launch of its Intelligent Tracking Prevention (\u201cITP\u201d) feature in its Safari browser. They \nalso include Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency framework which imposes additional user permissions for certain types of \nuser tracking. Even in situations where we do not engage in the type of user tracking that is the target of such changes, these \nrestrictions nevertheless may make it more difficult for us to measure our traffic in general, and, in particular, impair or limit \nour advertising attribution and conversion capabilities. Such restrictions, in combination with evolving legal and regulatory \nrequirements, may impede our ability to attract and retain advertisers who rely on access to such data.\nWe rely heavily on our ability to collect and share data and metrics to help new and existing advertisers understand the \nperformance of advertising campaigns. If advertisers do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our user base \nTable of Contents\n22",

If we are unable to \nadapt to product and policy changes in such ecosystems, or if we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable \nplacements within such ecosystems, our usage could decline and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and \nprospects could be adversely affected.\nBecause we make our products and services available across a variety of operating systems, networks, and websites, we are \ndependent on the interoperability of our products and services with popular devices, desktop and mobile operating systems, and \nweb browsers that we do not control, such as Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Any changes to \nthese operating systems, devices, web browsers, or online stores distributing our apps that impact the accessibility, speed, or \nfunctionality of our products and services or give preferential treatment to competitive products could harm usage of our \nproducts and services. Further, if such operating systems or application stores limit the availability of our apps, make changes \nthat degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, limit our \nability to target or measure the effectiveness of ads, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to \nus, or if our competitors\u2019 placement in such mobile operating systems\u2019 application store is more prominent than the placement \nof our apps, our user growth could be adversely affected. Any changes in such operating systems and application stores that \ndegrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to our competitors\u2019 apps could also adversely affect our \nplatform\u2019s usage across devices. For example, some operating systems have implemented or explored changes to the underlying \napplication architecture, such as Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency, or specialized infrastructure for advertisement-driven app \ninstallations, such as SKAdNetwork, which reduce our ability to target and measure advertising and, in turn, may negatively \nimpact the size of the budgets that advertisers are willing to commit to us. Some marketplaces have explored changing their \npolicies regarding what content is acceptable within an application. If we are unable to adapt to such changes, this could \nadversely affect our platform\u2019s access to and usage within those ecosystems. Moreover, if the number of platforms for which \nwe develop our products expands, it will result in an increase in our operating expenses.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to \nsupport our platform or effectively roll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to \nensure that our products and services are designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, \nand standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry \nthat enhance Redditors\u2019 experience. If Redditors encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or \nif we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of these operating systems, as well as policies and \nterms of service of the various application stores that make our apps and experiences available to our developers, creators, and \nusers. These policies and terms of service govern the availability, promotion, distribution, content, and operation generally of \napplications and experiences on such operating systems and stores. Each provider of these operating systems and stores has \nbroad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and policies with respect to our platform and those changes may be \nunfavorable to us and our developers\u2019, creators\u2019, and users\u2019 use of our platform.

In some cases these requirements may \nnot be clear or our interpretation of the requirements may not align with the interpretation of the operating system provider or \napplication store, which could lead to inconsistent enforcement of these terms of service or policies against us, and could also \nresult in the operating system provider or application store limiting or discontinuing access to its operating system or store.

We calculate our DAUq using internal company data. While this number is based on what we believe to be \nreasonable calculations for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring DAUq. DAUq is \nintended to capture traffic where a Reddit page has been viewed or the Reddit app opened at least once and, notably, include \nboth traffic from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as from those who have not logged in to\u2014or do not \nTable of Contents\n23",
  "have\u2014a registered account. In general, it is more challenging to accurately count logged-out traffic, since counting accuracy is \ndependent on deduplicating traffic where we do not have a registered user identifier. While we use various techniques to detect \nwhether the same user has performed multiple views, including cookies and traffic analysis, these techniques are not guaranteed \nto accurately deduplicate the traffic, especially for logged-out traffic. In addition, some visitors browse Reddit using an \n\u201cincognito\u201d or \u201cprivate browsing\u201d mode. Given the privacy protections surrounding such traffic, we often do not have adequate \ninformation to accurately deduplicate such traffic.\nOur DAUq metrics may also be impacted by our efforts to reduce the number of false, spam, and bot accounts in existence \non our platform. We regularly deactivate false, spam, and bot accounts that violate our terms or policies, and exclude these \nusers from the calculation of our DAUq metric; however, we will not succeed in identifying and removing all false, spam, and \nbot accounts, which means that our DAUq count could be overstated. We are continually seeking to improve our ability to \nestimate the total number of false, spam, and bot accounts and eliminate them from the calculation of our DAUq, although our \nquarterly average DAUq metric may continue to reflect such accounts if, in our view, the impact of their inclusion has an \nimmaterial impact on our average DAUq for the given quarter. Moreover, a single person or organization may hold multiple \naccounts and may use more than one account to perform multiple views within a relevant period. We lack adequate information \nto effectively deduplicate such traffic from different registered accounts that may come from the same person or organization. \nAs such, the calculation of our DAUq may not accurately reflect the actual number of people or organizations using our \nplatform.\nA portion of our historical DAUq metric counts views of pages that were hosted using Google\u2019s Accelerated Mobile Page \n(\u201cAMP\u201d) framework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relies on the accuracy and \ncompleteness of information received from Google used to compute the DAUq metric. Unfortunately, the information provided \nby Google historically was not complete and consistent. To the extent that our historical metric includes views of pages hosted \non third-party infrastructure, like Google\u2019s deprecated AMP framework, the accuracy of our metrics will depend on the \naccuracy and consistency of the information received from any such third party. As a result of these and any future changes, our \nDAUq metric is not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year, and may not be comparable period over period \nin the future.\nThe risks and challenges relating to our DAUq metric are also applicable to our WAUq metric, and while we may consider \nand possibly disclose other metrics in the future, such as a count of monthly visitors, there may be additional challenges with \naccurately counting such metrics. For example, deduplicating screenviews across an entire week, such as with our WAUq \nmetric, or across an entire month exacerbates the deduplication challenges described above. In certain cases, we may need to \nrely on estimation techniques to improve the accuracy of such metrics. The accuracy of these techniques will depend on the \nmethodologies chosen, resulting in a metric that may not accurately reflect the monthly traffic to our platform. \nWe regularly review and continually seek to improve the accuracy of and our ability to track such data, but given the \ncomplexity of the systems involved and the rapidly changing nature of mobile devices and systems, we expect to continue to \nencounter challenges, particularly if we continue to expand in parts of the world where mobile data systems and connections are \nless stable. In addition, we may improve or change our methodologies for tracking these metrics over time, which could result \nin unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. As a result, while any future periods may \nbenefit from such improvement or change, prior periods may not be as accurate or comparable, or we may need to adjust such \nprior periods. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to \nalgorithmic or other technical errors. In addition, our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which \ncould result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools \nwe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we \nreport may not be accurate.

Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that \nsuch metrics are no longer accurate or appropriate measures of our performance.\nErrors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could also result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. For \ninstance, if a significant understatement or overstatement of active users were to occur, we may expend resources to implement \nunnecessary business measures or fail to take required actions to attract a sufficient number of users to satisfy our growth \nstrategies. In addition, our advertising partners rely on our metrics to inform ad spend. Inaccuracies or perceived inaccuracies in \nour metrics, may result in advertisers spending less with us, which could negatively affect our revenue. We continually seek to \naddress technical issues in our ability to record such data and improve our accuracy, but given the complexity of the systems \ninvolved and the rapidly changing nature of mobile devices and systems, we expect these issues to continue, particularly if we \ncontinue to expand in parts of the world where mobile data systems and connections are less stable.

We have experienced, and expect in the future that we may experience from time to \ntime, interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability due to a variety of factors, including outages at our CSPs. Capacity \nconstraints could arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or data breaches or other \nsecurity incidents or attacks. Our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, and any \ndisruption of, or interference with, our use of CSPs could impair our ability to deliver our solutions to our users, resulting in \nlegal liability, user dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of users, and harm to our business. The level of service \nprovided by our CSPs, or regular or prolonged interruptions in that service, could also impact the use of, and Redditors\u2019 \nsatisfaction with, our platform and could harm our business and reputation. Since our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted \nperformance is important to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. \nIn addition, hosting costs may increase as our user base grows, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nFurthermore, our CSPs have discretion to change and interpret their terms of service and other policies with respect to us, \nincluding on contract renewal, and those actions may be unfavorable to our business operations. Our CSPs may also take \nactions beyond our control that could seriously harm our business, including discontinuing or limiting our access to one or more \ncloud services, increasing pricing terms, terminating or seeking to terminate our contractual relationship altogether (which they \nmay be able to do for their convenience), or altering how we are able to process data in a way that is unfavorable or costly to us. \nIf our arrangements with either of our CSPs were terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our \nability to make our content available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging for alternative cloud \ninfrastructure services. Such a transition may require technical changes to our platform, including, but not limited to, our cloud \nservice infrastructure which was designed to run on our CSPs. Making such changes could be costly in terms of time and \nfinancial resources and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nFurther, a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, power outage, \ntelecommunications failure, cyberattack, war, terrorist attack, sabotage, other intentional acts of vandalism or misconduct, \ngeopolitical event, pandemic or other public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic occurrence \ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. We have offices and a significant \nnumber of employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Furthermore, escalation of \ngeopolitical tensions, including as a result of escalations in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, or the recent \nescalation of conflict in the Middle East, could have a broader impact that expands into other markets where we do business, \nwhich could adversely affect our business, vendors, partners, Redditors, or the economy as a whole. Despite any precautions we \nmay take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our \nservices or disruptions in our activities or the activities of our vendors, partners, Redditors, or the economy as a whole.

For example, an \nattacker may attempt to automate the activities of an account or multiple accounts using a \u201cbot\u201d so as to mimic authentic user \nactivity, such as posting, commenting, voting, or clicking and engaging with advertisements. This sort of manipulation can \nresult in the promotion of inauthentic, low-quality content that is false, misleading, illegal, or undesirable. It can degrade the \nquality of our services and can also undermine the operation of our monetization systems, including our advertising systems, \nresulting in incorrect counting and charging of advertising partners.\nWhile we invest in efforts to detect and prevent inauthentic content or invalid traffic, including investments in proprietary \ntechnologies to detect and address content and vote manipulation, we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such \nabuses.

We are in the early stages of our content licensing \nefforts, and the market for content is new and evolving rapidly. There is no assurance that we will be able to sustain \nrevenues from these efforts.\nWe have explored, and will continue to explore, business opportunities in licensing Reddit content for purposes that do not \nconflict with our values and the rights of Redditors. We are only in the early stages of these content licensing efforts and we \nmay not be able to grow these efforts into a sustainable business. \nThe licensing of content for machine learning and AI training purposes is a novel business model without an established \ntrack record, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter in seeking \nto execute on this opportunity. Although we have negotiated content agreements with a number of partners that are medium-\nterm in length, to date, substantially all of the contract value associated with our licensing revenue is derived from two of our \npartners, and these arrangements may not be renewed, or they may be renewed based on less favorable terms, such as using \nfewer services at lower pricing. Our content license agreements are subject to terms and conditions, including API performance \nrequirements, that we may be unable to meet. In addition, our existing content licensing agreements may be terminated, not \nrenewed, or renewed on less favorable terms. The commercial market for LLMs may not develop or may be limited by \nregulation or other factors, and accordingly, the value of content for AI training purposes may be reduced over time, and we \nmay also not be able to secure arrangements on similar terms, or at all, with any other licensees. While our content licensing \narrangements include protections against abuse and misuse of Reddit content, we may be unable to adequately control the \nmisbehavior of partners or adequately protect our reputation externally and with respect to our communities. \nMoreover, some companies have and may continue to decline to license Reddit content and use such content without \nlicense given its open nature, even if in violation of the legal terms governing our services. For example, some companies have \nconstructed very large commercial language models using Reddit content without entering into a license agreement with us. \nWhile we plan to vigorously enforce against such entities, such enforcement activities could take years to resolve, result in \nsubstantial expense and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources, and we may not ultimately be successful.\nWe are subject to certain risks as a mission-based company.\nOur mission\u2014empower communities and make their knowledge accessible to all\u2014and company values are a significant \npart of our business strategy and who we are as a company. We believe that Redditors value our commitment to our mission of \nopen discourse. However, because we hold ourselves to such high standards, and because we believe Redditors and our \nmoderators have high expectations of us, we may be more severely affected by negative reports or publicity if we fail, or are \nperceived to have failed, to live up to our mission. As a result, our brand and reputation may be negatively affected by actions \nwe take that are viewed as contrary to that mission. In addition, adhering to our mission may negatively affect our reputation. \nFor example, we remain under continued public scrutiny with regard to the moderation of content related to global elections, as \nwe experienced during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In these or other circumstances, the damage to our reputation may be \ngreater than to other companies that do not share similar values with us, and it may take us longer to recover from such an \nincident and gain back the trust of Redditors.\nWe may make decisions regarding our business and products in accordance with our mission and values that may reduce \nour short- or medium-term results of operations if we believe those decisions are consistent with our mission and will improve \nthe aggregate Redditor experience.

  "If our operations or the number of third-party relationships continue to grow, our information-technology systems and our \ninternal controls and procedures may not adequately support our operations. In addition, some members of our management do \nnot have significant experience managing large global business operations, so our management may not be able to manage such \ngrowth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management \nprocesses and systems and effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base.\nFurther, although we expect to continue to grow our headcount in future periods, we have in the past, and may in the \nfuture, implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. We may \nnot experience the anticipated benefits, in whole or in part, of such strategic reprioritizations, and the related organizational \nchanges, including reductions in our workforce, could result in unintended consequences, such as decreased morale among \nremaining employees and reputational damage, which could make it more difficult for us to retain existing employees or hire \nnew employees in the future, greater than anticipated costs, the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, and increased \ndifficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. If we do not effectively redistribute the duties and obligations of \ndeparted employees among our remaining employees, or if employees who were not affected by the reduction in our workforce \nseek alternative employment, we could incur unplanned additional expenses to ensure adequate resourcing and our productivity \nand business could be harmed. \nOur business depends on attracting and retaining high-quality personnel in sales, services, engineering, marketing, finance, \nand support functions.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel representing diverse \nbackgrounds, experiences, and skill sets in sales, services, engineering, marketing, finance, and support functions. Maintaining \nour brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, is \nimportant to our ability to recruit and retain employees. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical \nand professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. Competition for \nqualified employees is intense in our industry, and the loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain, \nand motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our results of \noperations and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity \nincentive program. These measures may not be enough to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business \neffectively. In addition, we have a number of current employees who hold equity in our company or whose equity awards \nbecame substantially vested upon the completion of our initial public offering. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue \nto retain and motivate these employees, and the value of their holdings could affect their decisions about whether they continue \nto work for us. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be adversely affected by declines in the market price \nof our Class A common stock. If we issue significant equity to attract new employees or to retain our existing employees, we \nwould incur substantial additional stock-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be \nfurther diluted.\nAs our company grows and evolves, we may need to implement more complex organizational management structures, \nadapt our corporate culture and work environments, streamline our organization, or adjust the size and structure of our \nworkforce to scale for the future and execute our long-term growth plan.

Mr. Huffman is an at-will employee, which means that he could resign or could be terminated for any reason at any \ntime. Mr. Huffman is critical to the management of our company and instrumental in the development of our technology and \nour strategic direction, and should he stop working for us for any reason, it is unlikely that we would be able to immediately \nfind a suitable replacement. \nThe loss of key employees, including members of our senior management team, could disrupt our operations, adversely \nimpact employee retention and morale, and seriously harm our business. Further, if our senior management team and other key \nemployees fail to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be \nharmed. We also do not currently maintain any key-person life insurance policies. Even if we were to obtain such policies, the \nloss of Mr. Huffman or other key employees, including members of our senior management team, could adversely affect our \nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nTable of Contents\n27",

If we do not continue to develop our \ncorporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could negatively impact our ability to foster the innovation, creativity, and \nteamwork that we believe is important to support our growth. As our organization grows and we are required to implement \nmore complex organizational structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate \nculture, which could negatively impact our future success and harm our business.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Information Systems, and Intellectual Property\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be harmed by our failure to timely and effectively \nscale and adapt our existing technology and infrastructure.\nAs Redditors generate more content, we may be required to expand and adapt our technology and infrastructure to continue \nto reliably store, serve, and analyze this content. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance \nof our products and services, especially during peak usage times, as our products and services become more complex and our \ntraffic increases. In addition, because our cloud service infrastructure is run on CSPs, we cannot guarantee that we will be able \nto expand our infrastructure to meet demand in a timely manner, or on favorable economic terms. This is particularly \nchallenging with regard to increasing international traffic demands. If Redditors are not able to access our platform or we are \nnot able to make content available rapidly on our platform, Redditors may seek other channels to obtain the content, and may \nnot return to Reddit or use Reddit as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract new users \nto Reddit and advertisers and the frequency with which people return to Reddit. We expect to continue to make investments to \nmaintain and improve the capacity, capability, and reliability of our infrastructure. To the extent that we do not effectively \naddress capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and infrastructure to \naccommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and \nprospects may be harmed.\nWe continue to scale the capacity of, and enhance the capability and reliability of, our infrastructure to support DAUq \ngrowth and increased activity on our platform. We expect that investments and expenses associated with our infrastructure will \ncontinue to grow, including operating costs, the cost to acquire additional servers and networking equipment to increase the \ncapacity of our infrastructure, increased utilization of third-party cloud computing and associated costs thereof, and increased \nbandwidth costs. The improvement of our infrastructure requires a significant investment of our management\u2019s time and our \nfinancial resources. If we fail to efficiently scale and manage our infrastructure, our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our products and services are subject to attacks involving our systems or data, \nsome of which contain personal information, or that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, \nour products and services may be perceived as not being secure, Redditors and advertisers may curtail or stop using our \nproducts and services, and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be \nharmed.\nWe receive, collect, store, maintain, transfer, submit, and otherwise process personal user, employee, advertiser, and other \npersonal, confidential, or sensitive information, and data breaches and other data security incidents expose us to a risk of loss \nof, or unauthorized access to, this personal information, litigation, and potential liability.

For example, in February \nTable of Contents\n28",
  "2023, we experienced a data security incident in which an attacker was able to obtain an employee\u2019s login credentials to gain \naccess to certain contact information, internal documents, source code, and other internal business information. We also \nregularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for \npurposes such as spamming, engaging in coordinated information manipulation, or other objectionable ends. Our efforts to \naddress undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attack. While we take efforts to protect our \nsystems and data, including taking steps to protect the integrity of our APIs, there can be no assurance that our safety and \nsecurity measures (and those of our third-party providers) will prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our information \nsystems, data, and operations. Our technology may fail to adequately secure the personal information and other data we \nmaintain, and we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper or unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, personal information \nand other data, other data security events that impact the integrity or availability of personal information or our systems and \noperations, or the related costs we may incur to mitigate and remediate the consequences from such events. We may also \nassume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that our \ncybersecurity insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all applicable losses. Any systems failure or compromise of our \nsecurity that results in the unauthorized access to, or release of, Redditors\u2019 or advertisers\u2019 data or disruption of access to our \nplatform could significantly limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, \ntherefore, our business.\nIn addition, our products operate in conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products and components \nacross a broad ecosystem. There have been in the past, and may in the future be, significant attacks on certain of our third-party \nproviders, such as the LastPass cybersecurity incidents in 2022. We cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers\u2019 \nsystems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a \nbreach of, or disruption to, our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support us and our \nservices. If there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-party products or components and if there is \na security exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or \ncompetitive position. The natural sunsetting of third-party products and operating systems that we use requires that our \ninfrastructure teams reallocate time and attention to migrations and updates, during which period potential security \nvulnerabilities could be exploited. Third-party risks may also include insufficient security measures, data location uncertainty, \nand the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate, and our \nability to monitor our third-party service providers\u2019 data security practices are limited. Although we generally have agreements \nrelating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our third-party providers, they are limited in nature and we cannot \nguarantee that such agreements will prevent the accidental or unauthorized access to, or disclosure, loss, destruction, \ndisablement, or encryption of, use or misuse of, or modification of, data (including personal information), or enable us to obtain \nadequate or any reimbursement from our third-party providers in the event we should suffer any such data security-related \nincidents. Due to applicable laws, rules, and regulations, or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for any \ninformation security failure or cybersecurity attack attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with \nthem.

For example, technologies in our employees\u2019 and \nservice providers\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, \napplications, and other tools available to employees and service providers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. \nFurther, the security systems in place at our employees\u2019 and service providers\u2019 homes, or other remote work locations, may be \nless secure than those used in our offices, and while we have implemented technical and administrative safeguards to help \nprotect our systems as our employees and service providers work remotely, we may be subject to increased cybersecurity risk, \nwhich could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, and could disrupt our business operations. There is no guarantee that the \nprivacy, data security, and data protection safeguards we have put in place will be completely effective or that we will not \nencounter risks associated with employees and service providers accessing company data and systems remotely.\nMoreover, according to U.S. government sources and others, the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine has resulted in a \nheightened risk of cyberattacks against companies like ours that have operations, vendors, and/or supply chain providers located \nin or around the region of conflict or that are otherwise related to the conflict.\nOur data security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, theft, fraud, misconduct, or \notherwise, or third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, Redditors, or our advertisers to disclose sensitive or \npersonal information in order to gain access to our data or Redditors\u2019 or advertisers\u2019 data or accounts.

Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage or breach systems \ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable \nto anticipate these techniques, timely detect and appropriately remediate and respond, defend against such attacks, or implement \nadequate preventative measures. Moreover, the increasing sophistication and resources of cyber criminals and other non-state \nthreat actors and increased actions by nation-state actors make keeping up with new threats difficult, as the techniques used to \nobtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems or networks are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized \nuntil launched against a target. Additionally, attackers have used machine learning and AI to launch more automated, targeted, \nand coordinated attacks against targets. Consequently, we are not always able to, and may in the future be unable to, anticipate \nthese techniques, detect or react in a timely manner, or implement preventative measures, which could result in delays in our \ndetection or remediation of, or other response to, data security breaches and other data security-related incidents. If an actual or \nperceived breach of our or our third-party providers\u2019 data security occurs, Redditors and our advertisers may be harmed, lose \ntrust and confidence in us, decrease the use of our products and services, or stop using our products and services entirely. In the \nevent of a data security breach, we may also incur significant legal and financial exposure, including as a result of litigation and \nother claims, regulatory investigations and inquiries, fines and penalties for non-compliance with applicable data privacy-\nrelated laws, rules, or regulations, remediation costs, or indemnification requests. Any of these actions could have an adverse \neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to data privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify instances of \nmisuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on and off our platform.\nIn addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making investments in privacy, safety, security, and content \nreview efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties. As a result of these efforts, we may discover \nincidents of misuse of, or unauthorized access to, user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We have taken steps to \nprotect the integrity of our APIs, but despite these efforts, our security measures or those of our third-party providers or \nlicensees could be insufficient or breached as a result of third-party action, malfeasance, employee errors, service provider \nerrors, technological limitations, defects or vulnerabilities in our platform or any third-party platform, or otherwise. We may not \ndiscover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility \nover our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely, the \nallocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities may \ninclude the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, the existence of false \nor undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people\u2019s safety online \nor offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation.

Such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of \nour users\u2019 or advertisers\u2019 data, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend \nsignificant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address \nand eliminate vulnerabilities. In addition, our products and services are increasingly reliant on machine learning systems and \nAI, which are complex, subject to increasing litigation and regulatory scrutiny, and may have errors or inadequacies that are not \neasily detectable. The effectiveness of such AI systems and technologies could be impaired by incomplete, biased, or \ninadequate inputs or training data, which could lead us to make determinations or recommendations in our products or services \nthat have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.

If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a \ncertain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software \nto the public on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Any actual or claimed requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or \npay damages for breach of contract may allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and \ntime and, ultimately, could result in a loss of sales for us. Some open source software may include generative AI software or \nother software that incorporates or relies on generative AI. The use of such software may expose us to risks as the intellectual \nproperty ownership, license rights, and other legal rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and tools have not \nbeen fully interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts or been fully addressed by legislation. It may be challenging to ascertain \nwhether the authors of the original software had sufficient rights to support our usage of the software and data and models \nunderlying the software.

In addition to \nintellectual property risks, the use of this software may exacerbate other risks, including cybersecurity and privacy risks and \nother rights issues. This could adversely affect our reputation and expose us to legal liability as well as contractual or regulatory \nrisk. \nWe regularly contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal \nsoftware projects under open source licenses, and may continue doing so in the future. Our ability to protect our intellectual \nproperty rights with respect to source code which we have made publicly available may be limited. The terms of many open \nsource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in \nways that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize products or services \nincorporating such software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software \nin our products will be effective. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a \nmanner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open \nsource license, such use could inadvertently occur, or could be claimed to have occurred, in part because open source license \nterms are often ambiguous. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties asserting ownership of, or demanding \nTable of Contents\n31",
  "release of, the open source software or derivative works that we develop using such software (which could include our \nproprietary source code), or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could \nresult in litigation. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek \nlicenses from third parties to continue offering our products or services on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-\nengineer our products or services, to discontinue the sale of our products or services if re-engineering could not be \naccomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any \nof which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nFurther, the use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial \nsoftware, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. There is typically \nno support available for open source software, and we cannot ensure that the authors of such open source software will \nimplement or push updates to address security risks or will not abandon further development and maintenance. Many of the \nrisks associated with the use of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title or performance, \ncannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. Any of these risks could be difficult \nto eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain, protect, defend, or enforce our intellectual property adequately, which could harm \nour business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe believe that intellectual property is an important part of our industry and business. We rely primarily on a combination \nof copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, as well as internal security controls, confidentiality procedures, invention \nassignment and license agreements, and contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the \nUnited States and abroad. Various factors outside our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our \nproducts, services, and technologies. For example, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be \nsufficient or effective, and our copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights may be challenged, \ncontested, narrowed in scope, or held invalid or unenforceable. Further, in light of our reliance on a significant amount of open \nsource materials, we may not have the ability to protect certain of our information and technology. The steps we take to protect \nour intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to effectively prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, or \notherwise violating our intellectual property rights or to prevent unauthorized disclosure or unauthorized use of our trade secrets \nor other confidential information. We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property or in \nappropriately managing our open source catalog. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-\nconsuming and expensive, could divert management\u2019s attention and may result in a court determining that our intellectual \nproperty rights are unenforceable. If we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights in a cost-effective \nmanner, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be harmed. \nFurther, we have filed trademark and patent applications to protect certain of our technology and intellectual property. \nThere can be no assurance that each of our applications will result in the issuance of a registered trademark or a registered \npatent or that each resulting registration will be maintained.  Even if issued, there can be no assurance that our intellectual \nproperty rights will be sufficient to protect against others offering products or services that are substantially similar to ours and \ncompete with our business or that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our technology and use information that \nwe consider proprietary. For example, it is possible that third parties, including our competitors, may obtain patents relating to \ntechnologies that overlap or compete with our technology. If third parties obtain patent protection with respect to such \ntechnologies, they may assert that our technology infringes their patents and seek a licensing fee from us or otherwise exclude \nus from using our technology.

We have acquired in the past, and may in the future, acquire additional patents or patent \nportfolios, license patents from third parties, or agree to license the use of our patents to third parties, which could require \nsignificant cash expenditures. Any additional investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional copyright, \ntrademark, patent, or other intellectual property filings could be expensive or time-consuming. We may not be able to obtain \nprotection for our technology and, even if we are successful in obtaining effective copyright, trademark, and patent protection, \nit is expensive to maintain these rights, both in terms of application and maintenance costs, and the time and cost required to \ndefend our rights could be substantial.\nIn addition to registered intellectual property rights, we rely on unregistered intellectual property rights, such as trade \nsecrets, confidential information, know-how, and technical information. We seek to protect our intellectual property, \ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees, contractors, consultants, and other third parties who \ndevelop intellectual property on our behalf to enter into invention assignment agreements, and third parties we share \ninformation with to enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into \nsuch agreements with each party who has developed intellectual property on our behalf and each party that has or may have had \naccess to our confidential information, know-how, trade secrets, and technical information. These agreements may be \nTable of Contents\n32",
  "insufficient or breached, or may not effectively prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized use, disclosure, \nmisappropriation, or reverse engineering of, our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Moreover, these \nagreements may not provide an adequate remedy for breaches or unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information \nor technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated \na trade secret or know-how is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade \nsecrets and know-how can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or \nunwilling to protect trade secrets and know-how. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently \ndeveloped by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or \ninformation to compete with us, and our competitive position could be materially and adversely harmed. The loss of trade secret \nprotection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products and services by copying the functionality of our \nproducts and services. Additionally, individuals not subject to invention assignment agreements may make adverse ownership \nclaims to our current and future intellectual property, and, to the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, or other \nthird parties with whom we do business use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to \nthe rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nEffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate \nour business or offer our products and services, and our intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of \nprotection in foreign countries as they would in the United States because of the differences in foreign patent, trademark, \ncopyright, and other laws concerning intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nThird parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our intellectual property or \nother proprietary rights, and particularly as we expand the scope of our business and the countries in which we operate, we may \nnot be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating or challenging our use of, our \nintellectual property or proprietary rights, including those used to build and distinguish the \u201cReddit\u201d brand. If the protection of \nour intellectual property and proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the \nvalue of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our \ntechnologies, products, services, features, or methods of operations. We also may be required to spend significant resources to \nmonitor and protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights \ncould be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our \nintellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual \nproperty litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type \nof litigation. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits \nattacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. An adverse outcome in such litigation or proceeding \nmay expose us to a loss of our competitive position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may \nnot be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims that we violated certain third-party intellectual property \nrights, which, even where meritless, can be costly to defend and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services without infringing, \nmisappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we have been in the past, and \nmay in the future be, involved in lawsuits and other disputes alleging that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise \nviolated the intellectual property rights of third parties.

  "misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we have been in the past, and \nmay in the future be, involved in lawsuits and other disputes alleging that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise \nviolated the intellectual property rights of third parties. We may not be aware that our products or services are infringing, \nmisappropriating, or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights and such third parties may bring claims alleging \nsuch infringement, misappropriation, or violation. For example, the continued use of any AI technologies in our products and \nservices may give rise to risks related to intellectual property infringement. Additionally, companies in the technology industry \nown large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations \nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition and become increasingly \nhigh profile, we have received, and may in the future receive, more intellectual property claims against us. In addition, various \n\u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d and other intellectual property rights holders have asserted in the past, and may attempt to assert in the \nfuture, intellectual property claims against us and have sought, and may attempt to seek in the future, to monetize the \nintellectual property rights they own to extract value through licensing arrangements or other settlements or litigation.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not adversely affect \nour business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. We have incurred in the past, and may in the future incur, \nexpenses associated with litigation and settlement costs arising out of allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated, or \notherwise violated the intellectual property rights of third parties. Any such claims or litigation, even those without merit and \nTable of Contents\n33",
  "regardless of the outcome, could cause us to incur significant expenses, and, if successfully asserted against us, could require \nthat we pay substantial costs or damages, pay significant ongoing royalty payments, pay settlement or licensing fees, prevent us \nfrom offering our products or services or using certain technologies, force us to implement expensive work-arounds or re-\ndesigns, impose other unfavorable terms, distract management from our business, or satisfy indemnification obligations.\nIf any of our technologies, products, or services are found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate a third party\u2019s \nintellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing or using \nsuch technologies, products, or services. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially \nreasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors \nand other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and \nroyalty payments. We also could be required, including by court order, to cease the commercialization or use of the violating \ntechnology, products, or services. Accordingly, we may need to design around such violated intellectual property, which may \nbe expensive, time-consuming, or infeasible. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including \ntreble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. \nClaims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could similarly harm our \nbusiness. If we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any \nintellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or violation claims against us, such payments, costs, or actions could \nadversely affect our competitive position, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Even if intellectual \nproperty claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to \nresolve them, could divert the resources of our management and require significant expenditures. Any of the foregoing could \nprevent us from competing effectively and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Litigation\nOur business is subject to increasingly complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other legal \nobligations regarding content, consumer protection, competition, privacy, and other matters. Our existing and future \nproducts and services may subject us to additional regulatory requirements that could be costly and difficult to comply with \nor may subject us to other risks that could result in additional liability, reputational harm, or other consequences that could \nadversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. \nWe are subject to a variety of laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other legal obligations in the United States \nand abroad that involve matters central to our business, including content, intellectual property, rights of publicity and privacy, \nadvertising, machine learning and AI, marketing, distribution, competition, consumer protection, protection of minors, \ntelecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, blockchain, and securities \nlaws. The laws, rules, and regulations applicable to our business are stringent, evolving, and involve matters central to our \nbusiness, and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and \noperations.\nWe expect increasing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding the use and regulation of content made available on \nplatforms such as ours. We have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is \npublished or made available on our platform. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to \ndefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of \npublicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, sex trafficking, \nconsumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be various \nU.S. Executive Branch, Congressional, and state-level efforts to regulate the content made available on platforms such as ours, \nand to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.",
  "consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. In the United States, there have been and will continue to be various \nU.S. Executive Branch, Congressional, and state-level efforts to regulate the content made available on platforms such as ours, \nand to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. \nOur current protections from liability for content moderation decisions and third-party content posted on our platform in the \nUnited States could decrease or change, potentially resulting in increased liability for content moderation decisions and third-\nparty content posted on our platform and higher litigation costs. \nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-\nimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside of the \nUnited States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected \nunder local laws than we are in the United States. Numerous countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin \nAmerica are considering or have implemented legislation and regulations imposing potentially significant penalties, including \nfines, service throttling, access bans, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain \nprocesses. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition \nof fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure \nobligations. Content-related legislation and regulations also have required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to \nTable of Contents\n34",
  "change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide \nservices in certain geographies. For example, the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market expands online \nplatform liability for copyright infringement and regulates certain uses of news content online. In addition, the EU revised the \nEuropean Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states were required \nto implement into national law by December 2020. Further, Irish regulators have designated us as a video-sharing platform \nservice under their Online Safety and Media Regulation Act (the \u201cMedia Regulation Act\u201d), implementing their version of the \ndirective, and a court ruled against us in our challenge to that designation. The expansion and complexity of laws and \nregulations like the Media Regulation Act in Ireland, the Online Safety Act in the UK and Australia, the ePrivacy Directive and \nDigital Services Act in the EU, and others across the globe may increase our compliance costs and require changes to our \nprocesses and operations. \nIn addition, the existing and any future regulation of adult content could prevent us from making some of our content \navailable in various states or jurisdictions or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, \nand prospects. For example, the governments of some countries, such as India and Pakistan, have passed laws and regulations \nrestricting the distribution of content and products deemed to represent foreign or \u201cimmoral\u201d influences. Regulations aimed at \nlimiting minors\u2019 access to adult content could also increase our cost of operations and introduce technological challenges, such \nas by requiring development and implementation of age verification systems. U.S. government officials could amend or \nconstrue and seek to enforce more broadly or aggressively the adult content recordkeeping and labeling requirements set forth \nin 18 U.S.C. Section 2257 and its implementing regulations in a manner that is unfavorable to our business.\nFurther, there have been, and will continue to be, legislative and regulatory developments related to imposing new \nobligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods, and copyright-infringing \nmaterial. For example, we are exploring different ways for Redditors to purchase and gift virtual goods and receive rewards for \ncontributions to our platform, including through Reddit\u2019s earnings programs for contributors, developers, and creators. These \nprograms may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including laws \ngoverning money laundering and terrorist financing, money transmission, prepaid access and stored value, electronic funds \ntransfer, marketing of in-app purchases, virtual currency, consumer protection, taxation, unclaimed property, securities, banking \nand lending, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these \nlaws and regulations is not, and in the future may not be, clear. For example, in some situations, the SEC has found the sale of \ncertain virtual goods and non-fungible and fungible tokens to have been securities offerings and has fined issuers and taken \nother related actions to prohibit the sale and trading of such items. Moreover, to the extent our virtual goods and rewards \nproducts are deemed securities, our activities relating to these products could cause us to be required to register as a broker-\ndealer or exchange.\nWe also continue to pursue new business initiatives to empower communities through new technologies, including \nmachine learning and AI, blockchain technology, and non-fungible token (\u201cNFT\u201d) standards. These initiatives and technologies \nare subject to complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations, and governments and regulatory authorities may disagree \nwith our risk-based judgments about how these laws and regulations apply to our business initiatives, or may enact, interpret, or \napply laws and regulations that are inconsistent across jurisdictions. In addition, future legal and regulatory developments \nrelated to machine learning and AI, blockchain technology, and NFT standards may negatively impact demand for, and our \nability to offer, products and services related to these new technologies. They may also increase our compliance and litigation \ncosts, cause us to change our business practices, and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. \nTo support our business initiatives relying on blockchain technology and NFT standards, including Reddit Collectible Avatars, \nwe have acquired and used, and may continue to acquire and use, certain cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Matic.",
  "costs, cause us to change our business practices, and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. \nTo support our business initiatives relying on blockchain technology and NFT standards, including Reddit Collectible Avatars, \nwe have acquired and used, and may continue to acquire and use, certain cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Matic. \nCollectible Avatars rely on blockchain technology, NFT standards, and cryptocurrencies for their creation, existence, and \ntransactional validation on the blockchain, which exposes them to risks related to cybersecurity, malicious attack, and \ntechnological obsolescence. While we believe we have taken reasonable measures to secure our use of blockchain technology \nand cryptocurrencies, these risks, in addition to human errors and computer malfunctions, may harm or result in the loss of \nCollectible Avatars, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies we control. While we believe blockchain technology has \nsignificant potential, long-term adoption is uncertain. New legislation and regulations, law enforcement and regulatory \ninterventions, and judicial decisions may adversely affect blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, and future adoption of \nboth by consumers and businesses. Developments of this nature may also adversely affect the value of blockchain technology \nwe control, and our ability to buy, sell, accept, and use cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the future.\nWhile we have been expanding the use of machine learning across the platform, we have also been exploring the use of \ngenerative AI within our platform, as well as the use and licensing of Reddit content for generative AI purposes. For example, \nwe are experimenting with using generative AI to scale our content translation efforts as we grow our presence in international \nmarkets, to assist Redditors to find more relevant content and to create post and comment suggestions that abide by community \nrules. We are also experimenting with using generative AI to assist advertisers to create ads, improve the placement of \nTable of Contents\n35",
  "advertisements on our platform, and strengthen the offerings and functionality of our advertising tools. If we do not have \nsufficient rights to use the data on which our systems rely, we may incur liability through the violation of such laws, third-party \nprivacy or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party. If our use of generative AI results in summaries or translations of \ncontent that are inaccurate, dangerous, or otherwise problematic, we may face direct liability for claims such as defamation \nrelated to such content without the ability to avail ourselves of intermediary protections. We may not be able to anticipate how \nto respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain \njurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. For example, the EU AI Act came into effect in \nAugust 2024 and applies to companies that develop, use, and/or provide AI in the EU and includes requirements around \ntransparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, and accuracy, and includes \nsubstantial penalties for non-compliance. This regulatory framework is expected to have a material impact on the way AI is \nregulated in the EU, and together with developing guidance and decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI and our ability \nto provide and to improve our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, \nresult in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, \nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nIn addition, we are in the early stages of our content licensing efforts and are exploring content licensing opportunities \nwhere we believe the opportunity does not conflict with our values and the rights of Redditors. These programs may subject us \nto evolving approaches to the regulation of this data and implicate complex and developing data privacy and data protection, \nmisappropriation, and intellectual property laws, rules, and regulations. Given the novel nature of these technologies and \ncommercial arrangements, we have received and expect to continue to receive inquiries regarding our content licensing efforts \nfrom regulators.  For example, in March 2024, we received a letter from the FTC advising us that the FTC\u2019s staff is conducting \na non-public inquiry focused on our sale, licensing, or sharing of user-generated content with third parties to train AI models. \nGiven the novel nature of these technologies and commercial arrangements, we are not surprised that the FTC has expressed \ninterest in this area. We do not believe that we have engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice, we expect to receive \ncontinued regulatory interest in our plans, and any regulatory engagement can be lengthy, unpredictable and may cause us to \nincur substantial costs. It is possible for any regulatory engagement to result in reputational harm or fines, cause us to \ndiscontinue or modify our products, services, features, or functionalities, require us to change our policies or practices, divert \nmanagement and other resources from our business, or otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects. \nOur efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and may still not guarantee compliance. We may also \nbe subject to selective or inconsistent government regulatory action or enforcement or be the subject of claims in private \nlitigation or other actions. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may \nbe subject to monetary fines or other penalties, and may subject us to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could \nsignificantly increase our operating costs. If any of these risks occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition, \nand prospects could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we value privacy at Reddit, we face increasing scrutiny and regulatory complexity with regard to data privacy and \ndata protection. If we fail, or are perceived as failing, to protect the data privacy of those who use or work at Reddit, our \nbusiness and reputation will suffer and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be \nadversely affected.\nWe receive, store, handle, transmit, use, and otherwise process personal and business information and other data from and \nabout actual and prospective customers, as well as our employees, Redditors, and service providers.

  "about actual and prospective customers, as well as our employees, Redditors, and service providers. As a result, we and our \nhandling of data are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations, contractual obligations, and industry standards \nrelating to privacy and data security. In some cases, these laws, rules, and regulations by various federal, state, and foreign \ngovernmental authorities and agencies impose obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor (or the \nequivalents thereof). These laws, rules, and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or \namended in a manner that could harm our current or future business and operations. \nIn the United States, laws, rules, and regulations governing data privacy and security include those enacted on a federal \nlevel, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, and those enacted by certain states, such as the California Consumer Privacy \nAct of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), and California Age-Appropriate Design Code. \nAdditionally, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to governmental \nauthorities and affected individuals in connection with personal data breaches. Non-compliance with these laws could result in \nregulatory action, including injunctions and statutory civil penalties, and a private right of action. \nCertain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and \npersonal information than federal, international, or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may \nTable of Contents\n36",
  "complicate compliance efforts. This may result in further legal uncertainty, require us to incur substantial additional costs and \nexpenses in an effort to comply, and potentially require us to modify our data practices and policies. \nThe trend towards more stringent privacy legislation creates the potential for a patchwork of overlapping but different laws, \nwhich could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nSuch laws and regulations could also restrict our customers\u2019 ability to run their businesses, which may, in turn, impact our \nbusiness and operations. These laws, rules, and regulations may also impact our ability to expand advertising on our platform \ninternationally, as they may impede our ability to deliver targeted advertising and accurately measure our ad performance.\nWe are also subject to complex and evolving privacy laws in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) and the United Kingdom (the \n\u201cUK\u201d), such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cEU GDPR\u201d) and the United Kingdom General \nData Protection Regulation (the \u201cUK GDPR\u201d). The enactment of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR also introduced numerous \nprivacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU and the UK, including greater control for data subjects (including, \nfor example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU and UK consumers, data breach notification \nrequirements, and increased fines. In particular, fines for certain breaches are significant, up to the greater of 4% of total global \nannual turnover or \u20ac20 million in the EU (\u00a317.5 million under the UK GDPR). Since we are subject to the supervision of the \nrelevant data protection authorities under both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, we could be fined under each of these regimes \nindependently in respect of the same breach. In addition to fines, a breach of the relevant regimes could result in litigation, \nregulatory investigations or inquiries, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our data processing activities, \nenforcement notices, or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit). \nWe also expect increasing legal complexity and uncertainty regarding how and under what circumstances we can transfer, \nprocess, or receive certain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we \noperate and data shared among our products and services. These various developments in relation to international personal data \ntransfers require us to implement new or revised documentation and processes, within the relevant time frames, and are subject \nto ongoing scrutiny and potential future challenge, leading to additional costs and increasing our overall risk exposure. For \nexample, for data transfers to the United States, the European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision for entities self-\ncertified under the new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\u201cDPF\u201d). The DPF does not apply to the UK, and in October 2023, a \nUK-U.S. Data Bridge came into force to facilitate transfers of personal data from the UK to the United States. In addition, the \nother bases upon which we rely to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d), have been subjected to \nregulatory and judicial scrutiny. The Court of Justice of the EU ruled in July 2020 that reliance on the SCCs alone may not \nnecessarily be sufficient in all circumstances and transfers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In June 2021, the European \nCommission published revised SCCs for data transfers from the EU, but there is some uncertainty around whether the revised \nSCCs can be relied on for data transfers to non-EU entities subject to the GDPR. The European Commission has stated an \nintention to publish a new set of SCCs applicable to such transfers to non-EU entities subject to the GDPR. The UK ICO has \npublished its own International Data Transfer Agreement and the International Data Transfer Addendum to the SCCs (the \n\u201cIDTA\u201d), which came into force in March 2022. If the new DPF is invalidated in the future and we are unable to continue to \nrely on SCCs and the IDTA or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the EU and the UK to the United \nStates, we may suffer additional costs, complaints or regulatory investigations, inquiries, or fines, and we may be unable to \noperate material portions of our business in the EU or the UK, and/or stop using certain tools and vendors and make other \noperational changes, which would harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nThere are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted or evolving laws in the United States, at both the federal \nand state level, and in the EU and the UK that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business.

In \nthe EU and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements directed towards the protection of \nchildren\u2019s data online. For example, the UK ICO has reached out to us with questions regarding our compliance with the UK \nICO\u2019s Age Appropriate Design Code and UK GDPR. Further, EU national laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive \n(Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic \ncommunications sector) may be replaced by an EU regulation, known as the ePrivacy Regulation (Proposal for a Regulation \nconcerning the respect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications), which may alter rules \non tracking technologies, impose burdensome requirements surrounding obtaining consent and significantly increase fines for \nnon-compliance. If regulators start to enforce an increasingly strict approach, this could lead to substantial costs, require \nsignificant systems changes, limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities, divert the attention of our technology personnel, \nadversely affect our margins, increase costs, and subject us to additional liabilities. \nFrom time to time, governments, regulators, and other third parties have in the past, and may in the future, reach out to ask \nquestions or express concerns about whether our products, services, or practices compromise the privacy or data protection \nrights of Redditors and others. While we strive to comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to privacy, data \nprotection, and data security, our privacy policies, and other obligations we may have with respect to privacy, data protection, \nTable of Contents\n37",
  "and data security, the failure or perceived failure to comply with such obligations may result in investigations, inquiries, and \nother proceedings or actions against us by governments, regulators, or other third parties. Additionally, we have been in the \npast, and may in the future become, involved in data privacy-related litigation or other disputes. A number of proposals have \nrecently been adopted or are currently pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could \nsignificantly affect our business and operations.\nWe make public statements about our use, collection, disclosure, and other processing of personal information through our \nprivacy policies, information provided on our websites, marketing materials and public statements, and in the event that a court \nor regulator finds these statements to be deceptive, unfair, inaccurate, inadequate, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, \nwe could also be exposed to legal or regulatory liability. Any such proceedings or violations could force us to spend money in \ndefense or settlement, result in the imposition of monetary liability or demanding injunctive relief, divert management\u2019s time \nand attention, increase our costs of doing business, and adversely affect our reputation. Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting \nregulatory environment and trust climate may cause concerns regarding privacy and data protection and may cause our \ncustomers to resist providing the data necessary to allow them to use our services effectively. In addition, although we endeavor \nto comply with our public statements and policies, we could at times fail to do so or be perceived to have failed to do so. Even \nthe perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements \ncould negatively impact our business and operations.\nWe cannot assure you that any third-party providers with access to personal information and other sensitive or confidential \ninformation in relation to which we are responsible will not breach contractual obligations imposed by us, or that they will not \nexperience data security breaches or attempts thereof, which could have a corresponding effect on our business, including \nputting us in breach of our obligations under various data privacy and data protection laws, rules, and regulations, which could \nin turn adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

If such users circumvent these precautions or we are otherwise found to \nhave failed to comply with U.S. export laws, U.S. economic sanctions, and other countries\u2019 import and export laws, we could \nbe subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for the company, incarceration for responsible employees \nand managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges, and we may incur reputational harm.\nRisks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rates, results of operations, and financial \ncondition.\nThe tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. This challenge \nwill continue to increase as we expand our operations globally. Changes in tax laws, issuance of new tax rulings, or changes in \ninterpretations of existing laws could cause us to be subject to additional income-based taxes and non-income-based taxes, \nincluding payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, which in turn could \nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, the U.S. government may enact significant \nchanges to the taxation of business entities including, among others, an increase in the corporate income tax rate, the imposition \nof minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income, significant changes to the taxation of income derived from \ninternational operations, and an addition of further limitations on the deductibility of business interest. For example, on August \n16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the \u201cIRA\u201d) was signed into law in the United States. Among other changes, the IRA \nintroduced a corporate minimum tax on certain corporations with average annual adjusted financial statement income over a \nthree-tax-year period in excess of $1 billion and an excise tax on certain stock repurchases by certain covered corporations for \ntaxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. \nIn addition, many countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or \nrecommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations. In particular, over \nthe past several years, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) has been working on a base \nerosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project. As part of the OECD\u2019s BEPS project, over 140 member jurisdictions of the OECD \nInclusive Framework have joined the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges of the Digitalisation of the Economy, \nwhich includes a reallocation of taxing rights among jurisdictions and a global minimum tax rate of 15%. The Council of the \nEuropean Union has approved its directive to implement rules regarding such a 15% global minimum tax rate, and other \njurisdictions have already enacted taxes that target technology companies. We are unable to predict what changes to the tax \nlaws of the United States and other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would \nhave on our business. Any of these or similar developments or changes to tax laws or rulings could adversely affect our \neffective tax rate and our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to \ninterpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax \nrevenue. We are subject to taxation in several non-U.S. jurisdictions with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of \nwhich can be uncertain. The number of jurisdictions where we are subject to tax will increase as we expand our global \noperations. The amount of taxes paid in these jurisdictions could substantially change as a result of changes in the applicable tax \nprinciples, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedent, which \ncould have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. The relevant taxing authorities in a jurisdiction may",

The amount of taxes paid in these jurisdictions could substantially change as a result of changes in the applicable tax \nprinciples, including increased tax rates, new tax laws, or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedent, which \ncould have an adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations. The relevant taxing authorities in a jurisdiction may \ndisagree with our determinations regarding the income and expense attributable to that jurisdiction. If such a disagreement were \nto occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could \nresult in one-time or ongoing tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our \nbusiness.\nOur existing corporate structure has been implemented in a manner that we believe is in compliance with current prevailing \ntax laws, and our transfer pricing policies account for the functions, risks, and assets of the various entities involved in our \nintercompany transactions. The taxing authorities for the jurisdictions in which we operate may, however, challenge our \nmethodologies for valuing intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely \naffect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, changes to our corporate structure, including increased \nheadcount and expanded functions outside of the United States, could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely \nTable of Contents\n39",
  "affect our financial condition and results of operations. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our \nworldwide provisions for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the \nultimate tax determination is uncertain. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income \nand expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we \ncould be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax \nrates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our business, with some changes possibly affecting our tax \nobligations in future or past years.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited due to certain provisions of the \nInternal Revenue Code or state tax law.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, federal net operating loss \ncarryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) we generated in tax years through December 31, 2017, may be carried forward for 20 years and may \nfully offset taxable income in the year utilized, and federal NOLs we generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, \nmay be carried forward indefinitely but may only be used to offset 80% of our taxable income annually.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $590.4 million and state NOL \ncarryforwards of approximately $399.9 million available to offset future taxable income. Our state NOL carryforwards will \nbegin to expire in 2025 if not utilized. Our federal NOL carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely, with utilization \nlimited to 80% of our taxable income. Realization of these NOL carryforwards depends on future taxable income, and there is a \nrisk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future taxable income, which could \nadversely affect our results of operations.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the \ncorporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change federal NOLs and other tax attributes (such as tax credits) to offset its post-change \nincome and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a greater than 50 percentage point change \n(by value) in a corporation\u2019s equity ownership by certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period. We may have \nexperienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts \nin our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, our ability to use our pre-change federal \nNOLs and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income and taxes could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of \nstate tax law may also apply. For these reasons, even if we achieve profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of \nour NOLs and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and \nprospects.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to \nproduce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (the \"SEC\"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). These \nrules and regulations require, among other things, that we establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our \ninternal control over financial reporting. Reporting obligations as a public company place a considerable strain on our financial \nand management systems, processes, and controls, as well as on our personnel, including senior management. In addition, as a \npublic company, we will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), to furnish a report by \nmanagement on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our \nannual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. This assessment will need to include disclosure of \nany material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management. We have commenced \nthe costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation \nneeded to comply with Section 404, but we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in \na timely fashion once initiated.

If we fail \nto meet our obligations under the credit facility, our operations may be interrupted and our business, results of operations, \nfinancial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nIn October 2021, we entered into a five-year, $750.0 million revolving credit facility by and among us and certain lenders \nto fund working capital and general corporate purpose expenditures. The revolving credit facility, as amended, contains \ncustomary conditions to borrowing, events of default, and covenants. Covenants include restrictions on our and certain of our \nsubsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make distributions to holders of our capital stock or the capital stock of \nour subsidiaries, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates, and require us to maintain a minimum amount \nof liquidity. The obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets, including \nintellectual property assets.\nVarious risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure \nto comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit facility. Such a default could permit lenders to \naccelerate the maturity of outstanding amounts under our credit facility, if any, which in turn could result in material adverse \nconsequences that negatively impact our business, the market price for our Class A common stock, and our ability to obtain \nother financing in the future. In addition, our credit facility\u2019s covenants, consent requirements, and other provisions may limit \nour flexibility to pursue or fund strategic initiatives or acquisitions that might be in the long-term interests of us and \nstockholders.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on terms favorable to \nus, or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to \nbusiness challenges and opportunities, including the need to develop new products or services, enhance our existing products or \nservices, enhance our operating infrastructure, expand internationally, and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. \nIn order to achieve these objectives, we may make future commitments of capital resources. Accordingly, we may need to \nengage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity \nor convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue \ncould have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. In addition, the incurrence of \nindebtedness would increase our fixed obligations, and include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to \nmanage our operations. Further, if additional financing is needed, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms \nfavorable to us, or at all. Our inability to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, \ncould significantly limit our ability to continue supporting our business growth and responding to business challenges and \nopportunities.\nFuture acquisitions and investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial \ncondition, and prospects.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions  to expand our products and services, and \ngrow our business in response to changing technologies, Redditor and advertiser demands, and competitive pressures.\nOur previous and future acquisitions may not achieve our goals, and we may not realize benefits from acquisitions we \nmake in the future.

Moreover, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular \ncompany\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Securities litigation, if \ninstituted against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nInterest in our Class A common stock from retail and other individual investors, for reasons unrelated to our underlying \nbusiness or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals, could result in increased volatility in the market price of our Class A \nTable of Contents\n42",

For example, in  2021 and in June 2024, the market prices and trading volumes of certain securities, such as \nGameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., and other \u201cmeme\u201d stocks, experienced extreme volatility. The rapid and \nsubstantial increases or decreases in the market prices of \u201cmeme\u201d stocks may be unrelated to the respective issuer\u2019s operating \nperformance or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals, and the substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with \nthe risks and uncertainties that the issuer faces. This volatility has been attributed, in part, to strong and atypical retail investor \ninterest, including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums such as \nr/ wallstreetbets, one of our subreddits. Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the \npopularity of r/ wallstreetbets among retail investors, and the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading \nplatforms, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could experience extreme volatility for reasons \nunrelated to our underlying business or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals, which could cause you to lose all or part of \nyour investment.\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who \nheld our capital stock prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE. This ownership will limit or preclude \nyour ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational \ndocuments, and any major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval, including change of control transactions.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C \ncommon stock has no votes per share. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, \nthe holders of our Class B common stock collectively continue to control a significant percentage of the combined voting power \nof our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until a substantial \nnumber of such outstanding shares of Class B common stock have converted into shares of our Class A common stock. \nFurthermore, in connection with our initial public offering, Steven Huffman, our Chief Executive Officer and President and a \nmember of our board of directors, entered into a voting agreement with each of (i) Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. \n(\"Advance\") and (ii) Tencent Cloud Europe B.V. and Jojoba Investment Limited that provides, among other things, that Mr. \nHuffman is entitled to vote all of the securities beneficially owned by such stockholders and certain of their affiliates, in Mr. \nHuffman\u2019s sole discretion, on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. We estimate as \nof December 31, 2024, pursuant to such voting agreements, Mr. Huffman was entitled to vote shares representing \napproximately 74% of the voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. As a result, we are eligible to \nbe a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the rules of NYSE, which exempts companies from certain corporate governance rules \nrelating to the independence of the board of directors and its committees. Although we are eligible to use these exemptions, we \ndo not currently expect to avail ourselves of any of these exemptions. However, if we were to use some or all of these \nexemptions in the future, investors may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to \nall of the corporate governance requirements of NYSE and our \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status could make our Class A common \nstock less attractive to some investors or otherwise adversely affect its trading price. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the \nvoting agreement with Advance, Mr. Huffman is also entitled to vote all of the securities beneficially owned by Advance in \nfavor of directors designated by Advance and director candidates nominated or identified by Mr. Huffman.\nThis concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, \nincluding the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or \nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent \nor discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interests as one \nof our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A \ncommon stock, subject to limited exceptions, as set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, including",

The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will \nhave the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of our Class B common stock who retain \ntheir shares. In addition, the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock would dilute holders of Class A \ncommon stock, in terms of voting power within the Class A common stock. Any future issuances of common stock would also \nbe dilutive to holders of Class A common stock. For example, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights \n(except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock \nmay be able to hold significant voting control over most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of \ntime than would be the case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions.

Accordingly, the multi-class structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in \nindices with such restrictions and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt \nto passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, several stockholder advisory firms and large institutional investors have been critical of the use of multi-class \nstructures. Such stockholder advisory firms may publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or our \ncapital structure, which may dissuade large institutional investors from purchasing shares of our Class A common stock.

If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on \nus regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the market price or trading volume of \nour Class A common stock to decline. Moreover, if our financial results fail to meet, or exceed, our announced guidance or the \nexpectations of analysts or public investors, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may publish unfavorable \nresearch about us, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment \nwill depend on appreciation in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any \ndividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of \ndirectors. Additionally, our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make \ndistributions under the terms of our revolving credit facility.

Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe nature of Reddit\u2019s business makes the company susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. To address this, we maintain a \ncybersecurity risk management program with policies and controls designed to protect our platform and data from cyber threats. \nOur cybersecurity risk management program is intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical \nsystems and information. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan. We \ndesign and assess our cybersecurity risk management program based on applicable laws and regulations and remain informed \nby industry standards and industry-recognized practices.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares \ncommon methodologies, reporting channels, and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management \nprogram.\nOur cybersecurity risk management program includes:\n\u2022\nrisk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, \nservices, and our broader enterprise IT environment;\n\u2022\na dedicated security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our \nsecurity controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents;\n\u2022\nthe use of external service providers, such as third-party penetration testing firms, bug bounty programs, or auditors, to \nassess, test, or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity awareness training of our employees, incident response personnel, and senior management, including \nonboarding sessions and annual refresher training to address evolving threats; \n\u2022\na cybersecurity incident response plan that follows recognized frameworks (e.g., National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology Cybersecurity Framework), outlines procedures for investigating and resolving incidents, and is supported \nby automated tools for threat triage and resolution; and\n\u2022\na third-party risk management process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors incorporating evaluations like \nSOC 2 reports, annual reviews, and security questionnaires to ensure risks are understood and addressed.\nWe have not identified risks from known cybersecurity incidents, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, \nthat have materially affected us, including our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We face risks from \ncybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business, operations, results of \noperations, or financial condition. For additional information about these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this \nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit \nCommittee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. The Committee oversees \nmanagement\u2019s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program. \nThe Committee receives regular reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the \nCommittee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential. \nTable of Contents\n48",

Mr. Lee currently oversees Reddit\u2019s Security, Privacy, And Compliance Engineering (\u201cSPACE\u201d) team, which is \nresponsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our SPACE team has primary \nresponsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel \nand our retained external cybersecurity consultants. Our SPACE team has a strong foundation of expertise, developed over \nyears of experience in cybersecurity and engineering across diverse industries, including technology. \nOur SPACE team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, remediate, and appropriately report cybersecurity risks and \nincidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other \ninformation obtained from governmental, public, or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts \nand reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Francisco, California, where we lease approximately 48,000 square feet of \noffice space pursuant to a lease agreement that expires in 2029, subject to the terms thereof. We lease additional offices in the \nUnited States and around the world, including in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, and more. All of our offices are \nlocated in areas of the globe where we can attract the best talent and our employees benefit from a space to be together when \nco-creating and working to achieve our mission.\nWe believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our near-term needs. We believe that suitable additional alternative \nspaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if required.\nReddit\u2019s workplace philosophy is focused on providing versatility for employees while fostering a diverse and high-\nperforming company culture. Our ability to recruit and retain top talent is bolstered by Reddit\u2019s flexible work policy, which \nprovides support and opportunities for employees to work remotely or in one of our offices. This strategy, in conjunction with \nour competitive compensation programs reflective of the cost of talent in high labor markets like the San Francisco Bay Area, \nhas created advantages that have contributed to the growth and strength of our company.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government \ninvestigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims for infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating \nintellectual property rights related to our products, including our API, and/or the content contributed by our Redditors. \nAlthough the results of these proceedings, claims, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that \nthe final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or \nresults of operations. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such proceedings, claims, and investigations may nonetheless \nimpose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary \nand interim rulings.\nItem 4.

  "For more information about the factors potentially impacting our performance, see \u201cRisk Factors\u201d elsewhere in this Annual \nReport on Form 10-K.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics\nWe review a number of metrics, including the key metrics discussed below, to evaluate our business, measure our \nperformance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nUser Metrics\nDaily Active Unique. We define a daily active unique (\u201cDAUq\u201d) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier \nwho has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour \nperiod. We calculate average DAUq for a particular period by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and \ndividing that sum by the number of days in that period. DAUq is shown globally and also broken out by the United States and \nthe rest of the world because these markets have different characteristics. Most notably, we are more advanced in engagement \nand monetization in the United States than in the rest of the world. We measure DAUq because we believe that this metric helps \nmanagement and investors understand usage of and engagement with our platform. DAUq is the primary metric by which we \nmeasure the scale of our active user base.\nDAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to\u2014\nor do not have\u2014a registered account. Visitors that come to Reddit from search engines are generally not logged in and originate \nfrom both desktop and mobile web. Currently, monetization of these users is mainly through conversation pages and feed ads. \nMeasuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex. For example, prior to the first quarter of 2023, a portion \nof our historical DAUq metric counted views of pages that were hosted using Google\u2019s Accelerated Mobile Page (\u201cAMP\u201d) \nframework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relied on the accuracy and completeness of \ninformation received from Google, which had not been historically complete and consistent. As such, our historical DAUq \nmetrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To the extent that our metric includes views of pages \nhosted on third-party infrastructure, like Google\u2019s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend \non the accuracy and consistency of the information received from any such third party.\nIn addition, we monitor logged-in DAUq, which we define as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who \nhas visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period \nand was logged in to a registered account. We measure logged-in DAUq because these users tend to have higher engagement \nand spend more time on our platform compared to users who are not logged in to a registered account. \nWeekly Active Unique. We define a weekly active unique (\u201cWAUq\u201d) as a user whom we can identify with a unique \nidentifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a \ntrailing seven-day period. We calculate average quarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on \neach day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We measure WAUq because we believe that \nthis metric helps management and investors understand the reach of our platform.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we deployed further advances in our process used to identify \nand address activity by users and visitors, including web crawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove \nthem from our DAUq and WAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate DAUq and WAUq for prior periods if we assess \nsuch impact to be immaterial. As we have continued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen \nthis methodology materially impact trends in DAUq and WAUq from quarter to quarter.\nTable of Contents\n53",

Growth in \nDAUq depends on our ability to attract new users and retain existing users. We aim to increase DAUq by scaling \ninternationally, improving discovery and the user experience, elevating conversations and video, modernizing search, and \nproviding customized content recommendations. We believe we can grow engagement and convert more WAUq into DAUq by \nmaking it easier for new and existing Redditors to discover relevant communities and content. We believe we can convert \nlogged-out DAUq into logged-in DAUq by making the user experience, including search, simpler and more personalized to \nfurther increase engagement and retention. Growth in DAUq is also impacted by external factors such as worldwide events, \nTable of Contents\n55",
  "cultural trends, the global economy, and actions by external parties such as changes in internet search engine algorithms and \ndynamics.\nMonetization\nWe generate a majority of our revenue through the sale of advertising on our mobile applications and website. We built our \nadvertising business by focusing on top U.S.-based advertisers, and over time we have expanded our focus towards mid-sized \nand smaller advertisers, as well as international advertisers. The pricing of our advertising products is affected by our \ntechnological investments as well as other factors, including the global economy and the highly competitive nature of our \nindustry.\nWe also generate revenue from content licensing, Reddit Premium subscriptions, and products within our user economy. \nWe are in the early stages of monetization from content licensing and expect our growing data advantage to continue to be \nvaluable across several applications of LLMs (e.g., search, run-time inference). We also intend to open additional monetization \nchannels for Reddit by providing our users and creators with the requisite tools and incentives to drive continued creation, \nimprovements, and commerce.\nTrends in Monetization Metrics\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded revenue of $1.3 billion, as compared to revenue of $804.0 million for \nthe year ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 62% compared to the prior year period.\nARPU. We define average revenue per unique (\u201cARPU\u201d) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average \nDAUq in that geography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the \ngeographic location in which advertising impressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while \nother revenue in a given geography is based on the billing address of the customer. This differs from the presentation of our \nrevenue by geography in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form \n10-K, where both advertising revenue and other revenue are based on the billing address of the customer.\nWe present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize \nusers in the United States and the rest of the world at different rates. We measure ARPU because we believe that this metric \nhelps our management and investors assess the extent to which we are monetizing our DAUq. Monetization of new users is \ngenerally at a lower rate than existing users and as such, ARPU tends to grow at a lower rate than revenue in periods of strong \nDAUq growth. Currently, logged-out users tend to have lower engagement and spend less time on our platform compared to \nusers who are logged in to a registered account, and therefore, logged-in users generally contribute significantly more to ARPU \nthan logged-out users. Our ARPU reflects the seasonality of our advertising revenue, with the fourth quarter typically being the \nstrongest quarter of each year, especially in the United States, our most developed geography. United States ARPU is higher \nprimarily due to the relative size and maturity of the U.S. digital advertising market, a dynamic we expect will continue for the \nforeseeable future.\nTable of Contents\n56",

In \nour content licensing arrangements, we provide customers with the right to access content from our platform over the \ncontractual period. We recognize content licensing revenue as our content partners consume and benefit from their use of the \nlicensed content, which is generally ratably over the license period.

The \ngrowth in revenue was due primarily to an increase in advertising revenue driven mainly by an increase in impressions \ndelivered. In addition, other revenues increased as a result of content licensing agreements executed in 2024.\nCost of Revenue\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue     ................................................................................ $ \n123,595 $ \n111,011 $ \n12,584 \n 11 %\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $12.6 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year. The \nincrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to increased hosting usage to support user growth on our platform and an \nincrease in advertising measurement and other services, partially offset by lower hosting prices and hosting cost efficiencies.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n$ Change\n% Change\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nResearch and development   .............................................................. $ \n935,152 $ \n438,346 $ \n496,806 \n 113 %\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased by $496.8 million, or 113%, \ncompared to the prior year.

The decrease in income tax expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in taxable income in the current period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations primarily through net proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock \nand payments received from our customers. Additionally, in March 2024, we completed our IPO, which resulted in net \nproceeds of $600.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $31.6 million. We began generating net \npositive operating cash flows in 2024. Our primary uses of cash are employee-related costs and the cost of hosting our mobile \napplications and website. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash and cash \nequivalents consist of cash in bank accounts, money market accounts, and other highly liquid investments with original \nmaturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Marketable securities consist of U.S. and non-U.S. government \nsecurities, investment-grade corporate and government agency securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. As of \nDecember 31, 2024, approximately 2% of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held outside of the United \nStates.\nOn October 8, 2021, we entered into a five-year, $750.0 million, revolving loan and standby letter of credit facility \nagreement (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) of which $100.0 million can be issued as letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, \nwe have issued two letters of credit, one of which is denominated in a foreign currency, for an aggregate of $4.9 million, which \nreduced the letter of credit borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility to $95.1 million. The aggregate available \nbalance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $745.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOn May 23, 2023, we amended the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the \ninterest rate benchmark. Under the amended terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings can be either ABR Loans, Term \nBenchmark Loans, or SONIA Loans. Outstanding ABR Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the greatest of (A) the Prime Rate, \n(B) the NYFRB Rate plus 0.5%, (C) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.0%, or (D) 1.0% (each as defined in the amended \nRevolving Credit Facility), in each case plus 0.25%. Outstanding Term Benchmark Loans bear interest at the Adjusted Term \nSOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted AUD Rate (each as defined in the amended Revolving Credit \nFacility), as applicable, in each case, plus 1.25%. Outstanding SONIA Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Daily \nSimple SONIA (as such term is defined in the amended Revolving Credit Facility) plus 1.25%. We are required to pay a \nquarterly commitment fee that accrues at 0.15% per annum on the unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the \ncredit facility.\nTable of Contents\n63",
  "The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary conditions on our borrowing, including events of default and covenants. \nCovenants include restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make \ndistributions to holders of our preferred and common stock, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates, and \nrequire us to maintain a minimum liquidity. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by liens on \nsubstantially all of our assets, including intellectual property assets. We were in compliance with all covenants as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and amounts \navailable under our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at \nleast the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including \nour access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital needs. \nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities    ......................................... $ \n222,068 $ \n(75,114) $ \n(94,021) \nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities   ..........................................  \n(440,687)  \n41,291  \n(804,183) \nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities    .........................................  \n379,535  \n(811)  \n(3,784) \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash  ........ $ \n160,916 $ \n(34,634) $ \n(901,988) \nFree Cash Flow   ................................................................................................. $ \n215,820 $ \n(84,838) $ \n(100,254) \nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $222.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, resulting primarily \nfrom adjustments for non-cash items, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense of $801.6 million, and an increase \nin accrued expenses and other liabilities of $59.3 million due to timing of payments. These increases were partially offset by net \nloss of $(484.3) million, an increase in accounts receivable of $104.3 million related to an increase in advertising revenue, and \namortization of premium (accretion of discount) on marketable securities, net, of $(43.4) million. Net cash used in operating \nactivities was $(75.1) million in the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting primarily from net loss of $(90.8) million, and an \nincrease in accounts receivable of $53.3 million related to an increase in advertising revenue. These increases were partially \noffset by adjustments for non-cash items, primarily related to stock-based compensation expense of $47.6 million, and an \nincrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $25.2 million due to timing of payments.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $(440.7) million in the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to additional \npurchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $17.1 million, partially \noffset by maturities of marketable securities of $1.6 billion. Net cash provided by investing activities was $41.3 million in the \nyear ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to maturities and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $1.3 billion, \npartially offset by additional purchases of marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $379.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and consisted primarily \nof cash proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock in our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of \n$600.0 million and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of $89.0 million, partially offset by taxes paid related to \nnet share settlement of restricted stock units of $294.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $(0.8) million in the \nyear ended December 31, 2023 and consisted primarily of cash payments of $4.3 million for taxes paid related to net share \nsettlement of restricted stock units and other financing activities of $4.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from exercises of \nemployee stock options of $8.4 million.\nTable of Contents\n64",
  "Free Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow was $215.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and was composed of net cash provided by \noperating activities, resulting primarily from adjustments for non-cash items, partially offset by net loss and changes in working \ncapital. Free Cash Flow was $(84.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and was composed of net cash used in \noperating activities, resulting primarily from net loss, partially offset by adjustments for non-cash items and changes in working \ncapital. Free Cash Flow also included purchases of property and equipment of $6.2 million and $9.7 million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the increase in Free Cash Flow as \ncompared to the prior year was driven primarily by the increase in cash provided by operating activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing arrangements \nor any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured \nfinance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other \ncontractually narrow or limited purposes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2024:\nTotal\nLess than 1 \nYear\n1\u20133 Years\n3\u20135 Years\n(in thousands)\nOperating leases      ............................................................................ $ \n30,165 $ \n7,509 $ \n14,916 $ \n7,740 \nPurchase commitments  ..................................................................  \n336,978  \n173,662  \n163,313  \n3 \nTotal  ............................................................................................... $ \n367,143 $ \n181,171 $ \n178,229 $ \n7,743 \nUnder the terms of certain of our purchase commitments, we are contractually obligated to purchase specified minimums \nover the contract term.

Preparing these financial statements \nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and \nrelated disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical \nexperience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could \ndiffer significantly from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our \nfuture financial statement presentation, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows will be affected.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe to have the most significant impact on our \nconsolidated financial statements are described below. Refer to Note 2\u2014Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting \nPolicies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for \nfurther information on our other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate a majority of our revenue through the sale of advertising on our mobile applications and website. Other \nrevenue consists of revenue from content licensing, Reddit Premium subscriptions, and products within our user economy.\nWe determine revenue recognition by identifying the contract or contracts with a customer, identifying the performance \nobligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in \nthe contract, and recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nTable of Contents\n65",
  "For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we identify each distinct performance obligation and \ndetermine the transaction price, which may include an estimation of variable consideration, subject to constraint. The \ntransaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the stand-alone selling price, which is generally based on the \nobservable price of each good or service.\nWe recognize advertising revenue only after transferring control of promised goods or services to customers, which occurs \nwhen a user clicks on an ad contracted on a cost per click (\u201cCPC\u201d) basis, views an ad contracted on a cost per thousand \nimpressions (\u201cCPM\u201d) basis, views a video ad contracted on a cost per view (\u201cCPV\u201d) basis, or on a fixed fee basis, based upon \nad delivery over the service period, which is typically less than 30 days in duration. Generally, we recognize advertising \nrevenue on a gross basis since we control the advertising units before being transferred to our users. In arrangements where \nanother party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent. In \nthis evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. \nFor advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. For the periods \npresented, revenue for arrangements where we are the agent was not material.\nThe transaction price in advertising arrangements is generally calculated as the number of advertising units delivered \nmultiplied by the contractually agreed upon CPC, CPM, or CPV, or on a fixed fee basis and revenue is recognized based on the \nnumber of clicks, impressions, or views, or ratable over the service period, respectively.\nIn our content licensing arrangements, we provide customers with the right to access content from our platform over the \ncontractual period. The transaction price in content licensing arrangements is generally a fixed fee or usage-based fee. We \nrecognize content licensing revenue as our content partners consume and benefit from their use of the licensed content, which is \ngenerally ratably over the license period. We recognize Reddit Premium subscription revenue ratably over the subscription \nperiod, which is generally less than one year. Products within our user economy include Reddit Gold and Collectible Avatars. \nRevenue from Reddit Gold and Collectible Avatars was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards, including restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), \nrestricted stock awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d), and stock options granted to employees and non-employees based on the grant date fair value \nof the awards granted. Prior to our IPO, we did not recognize any stock-based compensation expense for RSUs with a liquidity-\nbased vesting condition because no qualifying event had occurred. Upon the effectiveness of the IPO, the liquidity-based \nvesting condition for such RSUs was satisfied and we recorded cumulative stock-based compensation expense using the \naccelerated attribution method. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to these RSUs will be \nrecorded over their remaining requisite service periods. For awards granted with only service-based vesting conditions, stock-\nbased compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. \nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO, the fair value of the Class A common stock underlying our stock-based awards was determined by our \nboard of directors, with input from management and reviews of third-party valuations of our common stock determined in \naccordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of \nPrivately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nOur board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous subjective factors to determine the best \nestimate of the fair value of our common stock, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe prices of recent issuances of convertible preferred stock by us to investors in arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u2022\nthe rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock;\n\u2022\nthird-party valuations of our common stock completed as of October 18, 2017, October 16, 2018, February 21, 2019, \nMay 17, 2019, May 31, 2020, February 8, 2021, April 9, 2021, September 16, 2021, December 13, 2021, February 16, \n2022, March 24, 2022, April 13, 2022, June 30, 2022, August 4, 2022, November 3, 2022, February 9, 2023, May 4, \n2023, August 3, 2023, and December 30, 2023;\n\u2022\nthe prices paid for common stock in tender offers and secondary market transactions;\n\u2022",

  "\u2022\nour developments and milestones;\n\u2022\nthe lack of marketability of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nU.S. and global capital market conditions.\nIn valuing our common stock, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business using various valuation \nmethods including combinations of income and market approaches with input from management.\nFor each valuation, the equity value determined by the income and market approaches was then allocated to the common \nstock using either the option pricing method (\u201cOPM\u201d), or the probability-weighted expected return method (\u201cPWERM\u201d). Our \nvaluations prior to September 16, 2021 were allocated utilizing the OPM approach. Beginning on September 16, 2021, our \nvaluations were allocated utilizing the PWERM approach. Application of these valuation approaches involves the use of \nestimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future \nrevenue, expenses, future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the \nprobability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between \nthose assumptions impact our valuations and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nFor valuations after the completion of our IPO, our board of directors has determined the fair value of each share of \nunderlying common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant. Future expense \namounts for any particular period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or market conditions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2\u2014Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements \nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for any recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently \nissued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk and \nforeign currency risk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $562.1 million and $401.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nWe had marketable securities of $1.3 billion and $811.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our cash and \ncash equivalents consist of cash in bank accounts, money market accounts, and other highly liquid investments with original \nmaturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Marketable securities consist of U.S. and non-U.S. government \nsecurities, investment-grade corporate and government agency securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Our \ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not \nenter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the relatively short-term nature of our investment portfolio, a \nhypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our portfolio or our \nconsolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\nForeign Currency Risk\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our revenue and operating expenses were denominated \nin U.S. dollars. We therefore have not had material foreign currency risk associated with sales and cost-based activities. For the \nyears ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our operations outside of the United States were not considered material and our \nresults of operations and cash flows were minimally subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency rates. We believe \nthe exposure to foreign currency fluctuation from operating expenses is immaterial at this time as the related costs do not \nconstitute a significant portion of our total expenses. As we grow operations, our exposure to foreign currency risk will likely \nbecome more significant. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies \nwould not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not enter into any foreign currency exchange contracts for purposes of hedging foreign \nexchange rate fluctuations on our business operations, although we may elect to do so in the future.\nTable of Contents\n67",

  "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors \nReddit, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Reddit, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December \n31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), convertible preferred stock \nand stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and \nthe related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results \nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with \nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express \nan opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \nwhether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal \ncontrol over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over \nfinancial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over \nfinancial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a \ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or \ncomplex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate \nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of the delivery quantity of ad impressions \nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generated $1,300 million of revenue for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024. The Company generates the majority of its revenues by delivering ads on the Company\u2019s \nwebsite and mobile applications. Revenue is recognized after transferring control of the promised goods or services to \ncustomers, which occurs when a user clicks on an ad contracted on a cost per click basis, views an ad contracted on a cost \nper thousand impressions basis, views a video ad contracted on a cost per view basis, or on a fixed fee basis, based on ad \ndelivery over the service period.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over advertising revenue as a critical audit matter. \nComplex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence over advertising revenue due to the \nproprietary IT system used to capture and track ad delivery used in revenue recognition. Specialized skills and knowledge \nwere needed to test the IT system used for the processing and recording of advertising revenue.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment",

Specialized skills and knowledge \nwere needed to test the IT system used for the processing and recording of advertising revenue.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment \nto determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over advertising revenue. We involved IT professionals \nTable of Contents\n69",
  "with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of a \nmanual internal control over the Company\u2019s advertising revenue process. We tested the capture and tracking of ad delivery \nwithin the Company\u2019s revenue systems by comparing known instances of ads viewed to system information for ads \ndelivered. We performed a software-assisted data analysis to test relationships among certain revenue transactions. For a \nselection of advertising revenue transactions, we assessed the recorded revenue by comparing the amounts recognized for \nconsistency with underlying documentation, including contract terms, ads delivered, accounts receivables, and subsequent \ncash received, if applicable. We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures \nperformed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of the audit effort.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2019. \nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 12, 2025\nTable of Contents\n70",

  "1. Description of Business\nReddit, Inc. (\u201cReddit,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our mission is to empower \ncommunities and make their knowledge accessible to all. We built Reddit with the belief that communities unlock the power of \nhuman creativity and create a sense of belonging and empowerment for their members. We believe the world needs community \nmore than ever, and that this represents our greatest opportunity to further enrich the lives of everyone in the world. We are \nheadquartered in San Francisco, California, and have several offices around the world.\n2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the \nUnited States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Reddit, Inc. and our \nwholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn March 20, 2024, our initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) was declared effective and our Class A common stock began \ntrading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 21, 2024. On March 25, 2024, we completed our IPO in which we issued \nand sold 18,576,527 shares of Class A common stock, including 3,300,000 shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the \nunderwriters\u2019 exercise in full of their over-allotment option, and excluding 6,723,473 shares of Class A common stock sold in \nthe IPO by certain of our existing stockholders, at a public offering price of $34.00 per share. We received net proceeds of \n$600.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $31.6 million. In connection with the closing of the \nIPO, all shares of our then-outstanding convertible preferred stock other than Series F-1 preferred stock automatically converted \ninto an aggregate of 67,917,432 shares of Class B common stock and all then-outstanding shares of Series F-1 preferred stock \nautomatically converted into 5,104,017 shares of Class A common stock. Following the IPO, we have three classes of \nauthorized common stock \u2014 Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock.\nCertain of our restricted stock units granted to employees included both service-based and performance-based vesting \nconditions (\u201cDouble Trigger RSUs\u201d). The performance condition related to these awards was satisfied upon the effectiveness of \nthe IPO. Upon the effectiveness of the IPO, we recognized $534.7 million of stock-based compensation expense. To meet the \nrelated tax withholding requirements, we withheld 4,861,113 shares of the 10,502,390 shares of Class A common stock issued \nand 723,341 shares of the 1,347,456 shares of Class B common stock issued. Based on the IPO public offering price of $34.00 \nper share, the tax withholding obligation was $189.9 million.\nIn connection with our IPO, we amended and restated our certificate of incorporation (\u201cRestated Certificate\u201d) which \nauthorized 2,340,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 2,000,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 140,000,000 \nshares of Class B common stock, 100,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, and 100,000,000 shares of undesignated \npreferred stock.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. \nManagement\u2019s estimates are based on historical information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and \nvarious other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from \nthose estimates.\nSignificant estimates relate primarily to determining the fair value of stock-based awards, the fair value of assets and \nliabilities assumed in business combinations, and the incremental borrowing rate used to determine operating lease right-of-use \nassets and lease liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates our estimates compared to historical experience and \ntrends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate a majority of our revenue through the sale of advertising on our mobile applications and website. Other \nrevenue consists of revenue from content licensing, Reddit Premium subscriptions, and products within our user economy.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n76",
  "We determine revenue recognition by identifying the contract or contracts with a customer, identifying the performance \nobligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in \nthe contract, and recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nFor customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we identify each distinct performance obligation and \ndetermine the transaction price, which may include an estimation of variable consideration, subject to constraint. The \ntransaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the stand-alone selling price, which is generally based on the \nobservable price of each good or service.\nPayments for revenue arrangements are due based on the contractually stated payment terms, usually within 30 to 60 days. \nSales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. \nAdvertising Revenue\nWe recognize advertising revenue only after transferring control of promised goods or services to customers, which occurs \nwhen a user clicks on an ad contracted on a cost per click (\u201cCPC\u201d) basis, views an ad contracted on a cost per thousand \nimpressions (\u201cCPM\u201d) basis, views a video ad contracted on a cost per view (\u201cCPV\u201d) basis, or on a fixed fee basis, based upon \nad delivery over the service period, which is typically less than 30 days in duration. Generally, we recognize advertising \nrevenue on a gross basis since we control the advertising units before being transferred to our users. In arrangements where \nanother party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent. In \nthis evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. \nFor advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. For the periods \npresented, revenue for arrangements where we are the agent was not material.\nThe transaction price in advertising arrangements is generally calculated as the number of advertising units delivered \nmultiplied by the contractually agreed upon CPC, CPM, or CPV, or on a fixed fee basis and revenue is recognized based on the \nnumber of clicks, impressions, or views, or ratable over the service period, respectively.\nOther Revenue\nIn our content licensing arrangements, we provide customers with the right to access content from our platform over the \ncontractual period. The transaction price in content licensing arrangements is generally a fixed fee or usage-based fee. We \nrecognize content licensing revenue as our content partners consume and benefit from their use of the licensed content, which is \ngenerally ratably over the license period. We recognize Reddit Premium subscription revenue ratably over the subscription \nperiod, which is generally less than one year. Products within our user economy include Reddit Gold and Collectible Avatars. \nRevenue from Reddit Gold and Collectible Avatars was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of payments to third parties for the cost of hosting and supporting our mobile \napplications and website. In addition, cost of revenue includes expenses directly associated with the delivery of our advertising \nand other services, including advertising measurement services and credit card and other transaction processing fees. Cost of \nrevenue also consists of employee-related costs, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs including salaries, benefits, and stock-\nbased compensation for engineers and other employees engaged in the research, design, and development of new and existing \nproducts. Research and development expenses also include professional services and hosting costs associated with internal \nresearch and development activities, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs including salaries, benefits, and stock-based \ncompensation for employees engaged in sales, sales support, business and brand development, marketing, and customer service \nfunctions. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expenses as the expected period of benefit is one \nyear or less. Sales and marketing expenses also include costs incurred for advertising, market research, branding, professional \nservices, marketing, and promotional expenditures, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n77",
  "General and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs including salaries, benefits, and stock-\nbased compensation for certain executives as well as employees engaged in finance, legal, human resources, information \ntechnology, communications, and other administrative teams. General and administrative expenses also include costs incurred \nfor professional services, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $9.2 million, $8.2 million, and $34.4 million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards, including restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), \nrestricted stock awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d), and stock options granted to employees and non-employees based on the grant date fair value \nof the awards granted. Prior to the IPO, for secondary sale transactions with existing investors, we recognized stock-based \ncompensation expense representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of our common stock on the date of the \ntransaction.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Under this method, the tax provision includes taxes \ncurrently due plus the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary \ndifferences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements, as well \nas from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to \nbe in effect when the taxes will be paid or refund received, as provided for under currently enacted tax law. In assessing the \nneed for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the \ndeferred tax assets. If, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not \nbe realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the income \ntax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized \nincome tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. An uncertain \nincome tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Any interest and penalties \nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFunctional Currency\nGenerally, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency for our subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign currency denominated \nmonetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date and foreign currency \ndenominated non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses \nfrom foreign currency remeasurement and settlements are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated \nstatements of operations. Net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, \n2023, and 2022.\nOn January 1, 2024, we changed the functional currency of our U.K. subsidiary, Reddit UK Limited, from the U.S. dollar \nto the British pound. The change in functional currency is due primarily to the increased exposure to the British pound as our \nfuture operating cash flows for our U.K. subsidiary are expected to be in British pounds. We translate the financial statements \nof the U.K. subsidiary to U.S. dollars at exchange rates at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and at monthly average \nexchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive \nincome (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity (deficit). The change in the functional currency of Reddit UK Limited was \naccounted for prospectively from January 1, 2024 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of \npurchase. We define restricted cash as cash that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. Restricted cash is \nclassified as current or noncurrent assets based on the contractual or estimated term of the remaining restriction. As of \nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n78",
  "December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets was not \nmaterial.\nMarketable Securities\nWe hold investments in marketable securities consisting of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, investment-grade \ncorporate and government agency securities, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. We classify our marketable \nsecurities as available-for-sale investments in current assets because they represent investments available for current operations. \nOur available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other \ncomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit). Expected losses from credit related impairment, if any, are \nrecognized through an allowance for credit losses and adjusted each period for changes in credit risk. Gains or losses on the sale \nor maturities of marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in other income \n(expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Other financial instruments, including cash, cash \nequivalents, and restricted cash, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. Additionally, the carrying amounts of \naccounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current \nliabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount, net of any allowance for doubtful accounts due to expected credit \nlosses and potentially uncollectible receivables. We apply a \u201csingle loss\u201d rate approach to the overall accounts receivable \nportfolio and also evaluate the aging, historical write-offs, and collectability of accounts receivable on a customer-by-customer \nbasis. The allowance for doubtful accounts was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nContract Assets\nWhen revenue recognition exceeds the amounts billable on a contract, the difference is recorded as a contract asset. The \ncurrent portion of contract assets included within accounts receivable, net, and the noncurrent portion of contract assets \nincluded within other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets were not material as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line \nmethod over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally three to five years for computer equipment, furniture, \nand fixtures. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the assets. \nMaintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs include costs to develop software to be used to meet internal needs and applications used to \ndeliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is \ncomplete, it is probable that the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Due \nto the iterative process of our development projects, development costs meeting our capitalization criteria were not material for \nthe periods presented.\nLeases\nLeases arise from contractual obligations that convey the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment \nfor a period of time in exchange for consideration. We determine if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. All of \nour leases are operating leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets, net, operating lease liabilities, and \noperating lease liabilities, non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on \nthe present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease right-\nof-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, \nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n79",
  "the incremental borrowing rate used is estimated based on what we would have to pay on a collateralized basis over a similar \nterm as the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments and any variable payments based on an index or rate, and are \nrecognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nPrior to our IPO, deferred offering costs, which consisted of direct incremental legal, accounting, consulting, and other fees \nrelated to the IPO, were capitalized in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets. After the IPO, the deferred \noffering costs were reclassified into additional paid-in capital as an offset against IPO proceeds. Deferred offering costs \nincluded in other noncurrent assets were $16.5 million as of December 31, 2023. \nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire from the date of acquisition. We determine the fair \nvalue of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective date of acquisition. \nThe excess purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair \nvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates including the \nselection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable \ncompanies. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain and \nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nWhen we issue cash payments or grants of equity to selling stockholders in connection with an acquisition, we evaluate \nwhether the payments or awards are compensatory. This evaluation includes whether cash payments or stock award vesting is \ncontingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is \nrequired for the cash to be paid or stock awards to vest, the award is treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and is \nrecognized as compensation expense.\nTransaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred and are included in general and \nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in a \nbusiness combination. We perform our annual impairment test on October 1. We also test for impairment whenever events or \ncircumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill has been impaired. Our impairment tests are based on a single operating \nsegment and reporting unit structure. No impairment charges were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, \nand 2022.\nAcquired Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable acquired intangible assets consist primarily of acquisition-related developed technology. We determine the \nappropriate useful life of our intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows of the acquired assets. \nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of up to five years.\nCryptocurrency\nWe account for cryptocurrency investments, and cryptocurrency received in exchange for goods and services, as intangible \nassets with indefinite useful lives, which are measured at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition, on the \nconsolidated balance sheets. Cryptocurrency accounted for as intangible assets are not amortized, but assessed for impairment \nquarterly, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the \nindefinite-lived asset is impaired.\nThe computation of gains or losses on the sale of cryptocurrency, or use of cryptocurrency to settle any obligations, is \nbased on the difference between the market price quoted on our principal market for cryptocurrencies at the time of sale or \nsettlement and the cost basis of the cryptocurrency, which is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. During the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, we sold the majority of our cryptocurrency portfolio, which consisted primarily of Bitcoin and Ether. The \nnet carrying value of our cryptocurrencies and all related cryptocurrency activity, including the gain recognized on sale, was \nimmaterial for the periods presented.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n80",
  "Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate recoverability of our property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets when events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Events and changes in circumstances \nconsidered in determining whether the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable include significant changes in \nperformance relative to expected operating results, significant changes in asset use, significant negative industry or economic \ntrends, and changes in our business strategy. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount \nto future undiscounted cash flows to be generated. If impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the assets\u2019 carrying \nvalues and the undiscounted cash flows, the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds \nthe fair value of the assets. We determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated our long-lived \nassets were impaired during the periods presented.\nConcentration of Business Risk\nWe primarily use Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform for our hosting requirements. A disruption or loss of \nservice from Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform could harm our ability to operate. Although we believe there are \nother qualified providers that can provide these services, a transition to a new provider could create a disruption to our business \nand negatively impact our operating results.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and \ncash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with \nseveral financial institutions. We believe that the financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents are financially \nsound and, accordingly, minimal credit risks exist with respect to these balances. We maintain investments in U.S. and non-\nU.S. government securities, investment-grade corporate and government agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial \npaper, and money market accounts that carry high credit ratings and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these \nbalances.\nNo customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. No \ncustomer accounted for greater than 10% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nSegments\nWe have determined that we have a single operating segment. Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision \nmaker who evaluates performance and makes operating decisions about allocating resources based on consolidated financial \ndata. \nEmerging Growth Company Status\nAs of December 31, 2024, we lost our status as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As a result, we \nare no longer entitled to take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and relief from certain other significant \nrequirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies.\nAs an emerging growth company, we previously elected to leverage the provision of the JOBS Act that allows an emerging \ngrowth company to delay the adoption of some accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private \ncompanies. We elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have \ndifferent effective dates for public and private companies through December 31, 2022. As a result, our financial statements for \nthe year ended December 31, 2022 may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting \npronouncements as of public company effective dates. Beginning January 1, 2023, we elected to irrevocably opt out of the \nextended transition period provided in the JOBS Act and began to comply with new or revised accounting standards at the time \nwhen adoption of such standards was required for public companies that are non-emerging growth companies.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) \nNo. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires disclosure of \nincremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.

  "in additional segment-related disclosures made in Note 18\u2014Segment and Geographic Information, but did not impact our \nconsolidated financial statements. \nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax \nDisclosures, which requires an entity to disclose specific categories in the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as provide \nadditional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This standard also requires certain disaggregated \ndisclosures related to income from continuing operations, income tax expense, and income taxes paid. The standard is effective \nfor us beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption will have \non our disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement\u2014Reporting Comprehensive Income\u2014Expense \nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires an entity to \ndisclose disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items.

Net Income (Loss) per Share\nWe compute net income (loss) per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for \nmultiple classes of common stock and participating securities. Prior to the IPO, our participating securities included Series A, \nSeries A-1, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series D-1, Series E, Series F, and Series F-1 convertible preferred stock, as the \nholders of these series of preferred stock were entitled to receive noncumulative dividends subject to certain requirements at an \nannual rate of 8% of the respective original issue price then in effect in the event that a dividend was paid on common stock.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n82",

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market \nparticipants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes \nthe inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\u2022\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\u2022\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data\n\u2022\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions or external inputs from inactive \nmarkets\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices \nor alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value.

Debt\nRevolving Line of Credit\nOn October 8, 2021, we entered into a five-year, $750.0 million, revolving loan and standby letter of credit facility \nagreement (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) of which $100.0 million can be issued as letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, \nwe have issued two letters of credit, one of which is denominated in a foreign currency, for an aggregate of $4.9 million, which \nreduced the letter of credit borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility to $95.1 million. The aggregate available \nbalance under the Revolving Credit Facility was $745.1 million as of December 31, 2024.\nOn May 23, 2023, we amended the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility to replace LIBOR with Term SOFR as the \ninterest rate benchmark. Under the amended terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings can be either ABR Loans, Term \nBenchmark Loans, or SONIA Loans. Outstanding ABR Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the greatest of (A) the Prime Rate, \n(B) the NYFRB Rate plus 0.5%, (C) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate plus 1.0%, or (D) 1.0% (each as defined in the amended \nRevolving Credit Facility), in each case plus 0.25%. Outstanding Term Benchmark Loans bear interest at the Adjusted Term \nSOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the Adjusted AUD Rate (each as defined in the amended Revolving Credit \nFacility), as applicable, in each case, plus 1.25%. Outstanding SONIA Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the Adjusted Daily \nSimple SONIA (as such term is defined in the amended Revolving Credit Facility) plus 1.25%. We are required to pay a \nquarterly commitment fee that accrues at 0.15% per annum on the unused portion of the aggregate commitments under the \ncredit facility.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains customary conditions on our borrowing, including events of default and covenants. \nCovenants include restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make \ndistributions to holders of our preferred and common stock, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates, and \nrequire us to maintain a minimum liquidity.

  "Redemption\nThe holders of convertible preferred stock had no rights to redeem shares. The convertible preferred stock was redeemable \nupon the occurrence of a deemed liquidation event that was not solely within the control of Reddit. Therefore, convertible \npreferred stock is classified as mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheets. The carrying values of convertible \npreferred stock had not been adjusted to their liquidation preferences as these events had not occurred through December 31, \n2023.\n13. Stockholders' Equity (Deficit)\nClass A, Class B, and Class C Common Stock\nWe have three classes of authorized common stock \u2014 Class A, Class B, and Class C common stock. The rights of the \nholders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion rights. Each share of \nClass A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. \nShares of Class B common stock may be converted to Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder. In \naddition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock (i) upon any \ntransfer, except for certain permitted transfers set forth in the Restated Certificate, including transfers to family members, \ncertain trusts for estate planning purposes, entities under common control with or controlled by such holder of our Class B \ncommon stock, and with respect to Advance Magazine Publishers Inc., or any Advance Entity (as defined in the Restated \nCertificate), or (ii) upon the first date on which the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Class B common stock ceases to \nrepresent at least 7.5% of the aggregate number of then-outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Once \nconverted into Class A common stock, the Class B common stock will not be reissued. In connection with our IPO, the Restated \nCertificate became effective, which authorized 100,000,000 shares of Class C common stock. Each holder of Class C common \nstock is entitled to no votes per share.\nPreferred Stock\nIn connection with our IPO, the Restated Certificate became effective, which authorized 100,000,000 shares of \nundesignated preferred stock. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and \nrestrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges, and liquidation preferences, of \neach series of preferred stock.\nCommon Stock Reserved for Issuance\nIn February 2024, our board of directors adopted the 2024 Incentive Award Plan (the \u201c2024 Plan\u201d), which became \neffective in connection with the IPO. Under the 2024 Plan, 31,747,592 shares of our Class A common stock were reserved for \nissuance pursuant to a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted \nstock awards, RSU awards, performance bonus awards, performance stock unit awards, dividend equivalents, or other stock or \ncash based awards. The 2024 Plan also includes shares of our Class A common stock that remained available for grant of future \nawards under our 2017 Equity Incentive and Grant Plan (as amended, the \"2017 Plan\") at the time the 2024 Plan became \neffective. Following the effective date of our IPO, the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2024 Plan will increase \nby an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning in 2025 and ending in 2034, equal to the lesser of (A) 5% of \nthe shares of common stock outstanding (on an as converted basis) on the last day of the immediately preceding year and (B) \nsuch smaller number of shares of stock as determined by our board of directors; provided, however, that no more than \n185,661,778 shares of stock may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n91",

Under the \n2024 Plan, 2017 Plan and 2012 Plan, the board of directors may grant equity-based awards to eligible employees and directors. \nSubsequent to our IPO, all equity-based awards will be issued through the 2024 Plan and no further awards will be granted \nunder the 2017 Plan and 2012 Plan.\n2023 CEO/COO Equity Awards\nIn 2020, 2022, and 2023, we granted our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer RSUs with a liquidity-based \nperformance condition combined with other performance-based or market-based vesting conditions. In December 2023, certain \nof these awards were canceled and we concurrently granted the 2023 CEO/COO equity awards.\nAs part of the 2023 CEO/COO equity awards, we granted our Chief Executive Officer 2,990,511 RSUs covering 1,495,255 \nshares of our Class A common stock and 1,495,256 shares of our Class B common stock, and our Chief Operating Officer \n1,462,028 RSUs covering shares of our Class A common stock (collectively, the \u201cCEO/COO RSUs\u201d). The CEO/COO RSUs \nhave both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for 50% of these \nawards was satisfied on the grant date. The service-based vesting condition of the remaining awards is satisfied by rendering \ncontinuous service for five years, during which time the grants will vest quarterly. The performance-based vesting condition \nwas satisfied upon the sale of our common stock upon the consummation of a firm commitment underwritten IPO pursuant to \nan effective registration statement under the Securities Act or a sale event, which constitutes a change in the ownership or \neffective control of Reddit or in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Reddit (each, a \u201cLiquidity Event\u201d).\nAdditionally, we granted our Chief Executive Officer stock options to purchase 4,485,766 shares of our Class A common \nstock, and 1,495,256 shares of our Class B common stock and our Chief Operating Officer a stock option to purchase 2,924,056 \nshares of our Class A common stock (collectively, the \u201cCEO/COO Options\u201d) as part of the 2023 CEO/COO equity awards. The \nper share exercise price for 4,452,539 of the shares underlying the CEO/COO Options is $25.29, and for the remaining \n4,452,539 shares underlying the CEO/COO Options, the per share exercise price is $45.00, $60.00, and $90.00 for each one-\nthird of the shares underlying such CEO/COO Options. The CEO/COO Options vest quarterly over five years and have a \ncontractual term of ten years.\nWe accounted for the cancellation and concurrent grant of replacement awards as a modification of the terms of the \ncanceled awards. At the time of the modification, all of the canceled awards were improbable of vesting. The 2023 CEO/COO \nRSUs were subject to a Liquidity Event performance-based vesting condition and were therefore improbable of vesting. The \n2023 CEO/COO Options were not subject to a Liquidity Event performance-based vesting condition and were therefore \nprobable of vesting.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n92",
  "RSUs and RSAs\nService-based RSUs\nWe grant service-based RSUs to our employees, all of which relate to Class A common stock.

Double \nTrigger RSUs generally expire seven years from the date of grant. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is \ngenerally satisfied by rendering continuous service, generally for three to four years, during which time the grants will vest \neither quarterly or with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter.

We record stock-based compensation expense in connection \nwith these Double Trigger RSUs based on the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date using the accelerated \nattribution method over the requisite service period.\nWe also grant RSUs with a service-based vesting condition only, covering shares of our Class A common stock (\u201cSingle \nTrigger RSUs\u201d). Single Trigger RSUs generally expire seven years from the date of grant. The service-based vesting condition \nfor these awards is generally satisfied by rendering continuous service, generally for one to three years, during which time the \ngrants will vest either with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter or quarterly from the \nvesting commencement date. As a result, we record stock-based compensation expense related to these awards on a straight-line \nbasis over the requisite service period.\nService-based RSAs\nWe grant, in certain circumstances, RSAs with a service-based vesting condition, covering shares of our Class A common \nstock. The service-based vesting condition for these awards is generally satisfied by rendering continuous service, generally for \nthree years, during which time the grants will vest with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly \nthereafter.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs \nand RSAs granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $56.96, $26.71, and $37.88, respectively. \nThe total fair value of RSUs and RSAs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $766.8 million, \n$27.9 million, and $33.4 million, respectively. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and \nRSAs was $292.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.41 \nyears.\nStock Options\nStock option grants generally expire ten years from the date of the grant. Certain stock option grants allow for the exercise \nof unvested options to acquire shares. Upon termination of service, we have the right to repurchase, at the original exercise \nprice, any unvested (but issued) common stock. The grant date fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes \noption-pricing model. Calculating the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes model requires certain highly \nsubjective inputs and assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the stock \noption, and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. \nStock options vest based on terms in the stock option agreement and generally vest over five years quarterly or four years with \n25% of the award vesting one year from the vesting commencement date then ratably over the following three years.

Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense \nrelated to stock options was $111.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average \nperiod of 3.95 years.\nAggregate intrinsic value represents the difference between the exercise price of the options and the estimated fair value of \nour common stock.

The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-\nto-vesting and the contractual life of the options.\nVolatility\u2014We determine the price volatility factor based on the historical and implied volatilities of our peer group as we \ndo not have a sufficient trading history for our common stock. When considering which companies to include in our \ncomparable industry peer companies, we focused on publicly-traded companies with businesses similar to ours.\nRisk Free Interest Rates\u2014These rates are based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury notes with terms \napproximately equal to the expected life of the option.\nExpected Dividend Yield\u2014We have not and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nTable of Contents\nReddit, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n94",

We estimated the fair value of the common stock \npurchased in the secondary sales based on several factors, including taking into account the amounts paid by third parties for \nour common stock. As the purchase price for the secondary sales paid by our existing shareholder was in excess of the fair \nvalue of such shares at the time of the transactions, we recognized immaterial stock-based compensation expense in connection \nwith these transactions during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated \nstatements of operations for all periods presented:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue   ................................................................................................. $ \n620 $ \n101 $ \n133 \nResearch and development    ...............................................................................  \n441,629  \n23,825  \n35,641 \nSales and marketing     .........................................................................................  \n80,436  \n5,555  \n7,576 \nGeneral and administrative ...............................................................................  \n278,961  \n18,117  \n11,960 \nStock-based compensation expense     ............................................................ $ \n801,646 $ \n47,598 $ \n55,310 \n15.

  "As of December 31, 2024, we had $590.4 million and $399.9 million, respectively, of gross federal and state net operating \nloss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. The federal net operating loss carryforwards are able to be carried \nforward indefinitely but are limited to 80% of taxable income. The state carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development credit carryforwards of $123.9 million that will begin \nto expire in 2039 and state research and development credit carryforwards of $49.3 million that do not expire.\nUtilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \nownership change limitations provided by Section 382 of the Code and similar state tax regulations. Under Section 382 of the \nCode, substantial changes in our ownership and in the ownership of acquired companies may limit the amount of net operating \nloss and tax credit carryforwards that are available to offset taxable income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration \nof net operating losses and tax credits before utilization. Accordingly, our ability to utilize these carryforwards may be limited \nas a result of such ownership change.\nWe assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to \nuse our existing federal and state deferred tax assets. Based on the weight of the available evidence, including our history of \nlosses, we provided a full valuation allowance against our federal and state deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. The \namount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in future periods if objective negative evidence in the \nform of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our \nprojections for growth.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an immaterial amount of unremitted earnings related to foreign subsidiaries. We intend \nto reinvest these foreign earnings indefinitely and do not expect to incur any significant taxes related to such amounts.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits  .............................................. $ \n19,236 $ \n16,428 $ \n8,982 \nIncreases/(decreases) related to prior year tax positions   .................................  \n1,444  \n(1,750)  \n1,925 \nIncreases/(decreases) related to current year tax positions      .............................  \n23,181  \n4,558  \n5,521 \nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits    .............................................. $ \n43,861 $ \n19,236 $ \n16,428 \nSubstantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits were recorded as reductions in our gross deferred tax assets, offset by a \ncorresponding reduction in our valuation allowance. The unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not materially affect \nthe effective tax rate due to the full valuation allowance recorded against our federal and state deferred tax assets.\nOur policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. During \nthe year ended December 31, 2024, we had no interest expense or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. As of \nDecember 31, 2024, we had no accrued balances of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nDue to our net operating loss carryforwards, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the United States for all \ntax years. In our foreign jurisdictions, we are subject to examination for tax years ending on or after December 31, 2019.

However, the effectiveness of any internal control over financial \nreporting is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and \nevaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Because of the inherent \nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances \nof fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the \nlikelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all \npotential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the \ndegree of compliance with policies or procedures.
