  "Dear Shareholders:\n2024 was a strong year for Amazon.\nOur total revenue grew 11% year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) from $575B to $638B. By segment, North America\nrevenue increased 10% YoY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% YoY from $131B to $143B,\nand AWS revenue increased 19% YoY, from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS\nrevenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon\u2019s total revenue was $89B.\nAmazon\u2019s operating income in 2024 improved 86% YoY, from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to\n$68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved\nfrom $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.\nApart from the financial results, we made our customers\u2019 lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores\nbusiness, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm,\nProfitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the\nsecond year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new\ninfrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including\nour latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and\nsignificant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) services\nAmazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows,\nincluding new seasons for Fallout, Reacher, The Boys, and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, movies like\nRoad House, The Idea of You, and Red One, live sports like Thursday Night Football and UEFA Champions\nLeague in Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple\nTV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color\nversion, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest\nKindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price\ntransparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.\nThese accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention,\nhard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I\u2019m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this\npast year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won\u2019t be visible for the next\nfew years).\nA Why Culture\nEvery year in my annual letter, I try to share insight into what makes Amazon tick. At the highest level,\nwe\u2019re aiming to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company, making customers\u2019 lives better and easier every\nday. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite hard, especially with\nthe rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies\nalike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything\naround us.\nWe\u2019ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way\ndoor decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where\nyou were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. You can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-\nway door decision is one where it\u2019s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if\nyou get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs\nassume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed\nbolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we\u2019ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors\nhas been a simple question: \u201cWhy?\u201d",
  "\u201cWhy does this customer experience have to be this way?\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be better?\u201d\u201cWhat are the constraints\u2014\nwhy must we accept them?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t we invent around that?\u201d \u201cWhy will it take so long to get to\ncustomers?\u201d Why?\nMy Dad has told me that I was the kind of kid who kept asking why, perhaps to an annoying extent. He\u2019s\nalso reminded me how shortly after I joined Amazon in 1997, he tried to persuade me to work somewhere\nmore traditional (and on the east coast closer to family)\u2014only to realize that I\u2019d already found the perfect fit.\nThat\u2019s because Amazon is a Why company. We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct\nproblems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed\nimpenetrable. Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ (let\u2019s call it \u201cYQ\u201d), and it frames the way\nwe think about everything that we do.\nStarting in 1995, we asked why can\u2019t we offer customers every in-print book?\nThen, we asked, why limit ourselves to in-print\u2014why can\u2019t we also offer every out-of-print book?\nWhy not offer every book, ever written, in any language\u2014all available within 60 seconds on a device that\u2019s\nlight and fits in the palm of your hand (Kindle)?\nWhen we offer reviews, why must they all come from professional \u201cexperts?\u201d Customers are great resources\nand will be brutally honest. Why not include customer reviews even if they sometimes dissuade a purchase?\nWhy not offer more than Books? What about Music, Video, Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, Apparel, Home\nFurnishings?\nWhy not practically everything?\nWhy should we be the only sellers of these items? Millions of third-party merchants and small sellers offer\nsimilar or unique items. Why not let customers choose the selection, price, and delivery speed they prefer from\namong these millions of sellers?\nAfter struggling for a couple years to create awareness for sellers\u2019 selection, we asked ourselves why not\nshow their selection on the same product detail pages as our first-party selection (where all the traffic was)?\nWhy not allow our sellers to also store items in our fulfillment network, enable those items to have fast, Prime\ndelivery, and fulfill those items for sellers (a program called Fulfillment by Amazon)?\nWhy not experiment with relevant advertisements in our store to expose customers to new sellers and items\n(versus only what our algorithms might surface based on past purchases)?\nWhy does every company need their own capital-intensive datacenters and infrastructure? Why should every\ndevelopment team keep reinventing services like compute, storage, database, and analytics? Why should\nbuilders spend 80% of their time on the undifferentiated heavy lifting vs. their unique customer experience?\nWhy not build a set of services (AWS) to solve that for internal and external builders?\nWhy do I have to buy a physical video to watch a movie? Why do I need cable or linear TV to watch\namazing TV shows (Prime Video)?\nWhy can\u2019t I get my Prime shipping benefits on other websites than just Amazon (Buy with Prime)?\nI can go on. But, you get the idea. Every one of these Whys have led to significant invention, and every one\nof them have made customers\u2019 lives better and easier. Some of these seem obvious now. But at the time,\nthese were provocative questions that required curiosity, risk-taking, experimentation, and persistence to\nmake these into success stories.\nEnabling a Why Culture\nIf you believe having high YQ is critical to inventing for customers, how do you enable it? In my opinion,\nit\u2019s not solved with one mechanism. It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has\nto be fiercely protected over time if you\u2019re lucky enough to be successful. Here are a few of the strategies\nwe employ.",
  "Create leadership principles that set the tone. We have 16 Leadership Principles that guide our behavior.\nThey\u2019re all integral underpinnings to our YQ, but I\u2019ll touch on three in particular:\nAre Right a Lot\n\u201cLeaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and\nwork to disconfirm their beliefs.\u201d\nWhen we first instituted this leadership principle, some people incorrectly assumed it meant that the best\nleaders were the ones whose ideas were chosen (i.e. they were right, a lot). It led to some people overly digging\nin and fighting for their ideas. There\u2019s nothing wrong with pushing for what you believe. But, in my\nexperience, the best leaders want to hear others\u2019 views. They don\u2019t wilt or bristle when challenged; they\u2019re\nintrigued. Effective leaders change their minds when presented with new compelling information (which\nmakes it ironic how people dismiss politicians as \u201cflip-floppers\u201d when they change their position). Ultimately,\nleaders are responsible for getting to the best answer for customers, regardless of whose original idea is\nchosen.\nLearn and be Curious\n\u201cLeaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new\npossibilities and act to explore them.\u201d\nIn the nearly 28 years I\u2019ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and\nindividuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn.\nIt\u2019s hard to know the reason in each case, but it\u2019s as if some people find it too exhausting, too time-\nconsuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon\nis the day we risk undermining what we\u2019re capable of building in the future. People with high YQ are always\ncurious how they can get better, become wiser, and incorporate their new knowledge into better customer\nexperiences.\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n\u201cLeaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is\nuncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the\nsake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t just empower people to challenge one another, we obligate them to do so if they disagree.\nQuestioning, asking the hard questions, forcing the discussion (versus silently thinking a mistake is being\nmade) is necessary to getting to better answers for customers. \u201cI told you so\u201d has no currency at Amazon. It\u2019s\nalso important to focus on the second part of this leadership principle: disagree and commit. While\nconstructive debate is useful; at some point, teams need to make a decision and take action. From that point\non, everybody\u2014even those who advocated for a different solution than the one chosen\u2014must commit to\nmaking that decision a success. That means the team goes all in\u2014no pocket-vetoing nor hedging between\nother options. That\u2019s the only way we can preserve speed and confidence that if an issue is heavily debated, the\nteam will ultimately pull together.\nCreate norms that support the Why. Similar to how our Leadership Principles guide our behavior, we\u2019ve built\nnorms over the years that guide how we work. Here are a few examples:\nNarratives. We stopped presenting information to each other inside the company via powerpoint in 2004.\nGiven how high level powerpoints are, we found that powerpoint was easy for the presenter to prepare, but\nharder for the audience to understand the substantive issues. Instead, we moved to writing narratives with a\nmaximum of six pages in the body. Narratives are harder for the presenter (it\u2019s hard to write a thoughtful six-\npage document that highlights the key issues in enough detail to be crisp and clear), but much easier for the\naudience to engage with and ask the right Why questions.\nWorking backwards documents. When we build services or features, before we start coding, we write Press\nRelease and Frequently Asked Questions (\u201cFAQ\u201d) documents. The Press Release is intended to ensure that\nwhat we\u2019re proposing building is remarkable to customers (so we don\u2019t get to launch and ask \u201cwait, why\ndid we think customers would find this interesting?\u201d). And, the FAQ is designed to force ourselves to ask the",
  "hard questions about which customers will use this capability, what they\u2019ll like most, what they\u2019ll be most\ndisappointed with, why are we drawing the launch line where we are, why is it better than current alternatives,\nhow should we think about pricing, what pricing dimensions we recommend, and why have we made the\narchitectural decisions we have. The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and\nhow we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.\nBe together whenever possible. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally,\na lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it\u2019s\nnot how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then\na group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we\u2019ve found that\nthis process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and\nsome cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn\u2019t compare to being in the same\nroom. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way\nideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room\u2014and yields\nbetter outcomes for our customers and teams. With what\u2019s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood\nthat every customer experience we\u2019ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important\ntime, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.\nTolerating messy meetings. It\u2019s hard to \u201cschedule\u201d innovation. You can\u2019t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon\nPrime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or\nProject Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can\u2019t change what\u2019s possible for\ncustomers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before\ngetting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we\u2019re inventing, we accept\nthe process being beautifully imperfect.\nOperate like a startup (in our case, the world\u2019s largest startup). We strive to operate like the world\u2019s largest\nstartup. What does that mean?\nFirst, whatever we\u2019re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or\nmeaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because\nthey\u2019re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what\u2019s possible for customers.\nSecond, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They\u2019re people constantly\ndissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can\u2019t be better.\nThey\u2019re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they\u2019ve previously\nbuilt), and never feel like the job is done.\nThird, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we\u2019ve hired really\nsmart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our\nteammates are constantly asking themselves, \u201cWhat would I do if this was my own money?\u201d \u201cWhat would I\ndo if I started this company and I was the majority owner?\u201d \u201cHey, I know I\u2019ve only been asked to own a\npart of this project, but I\u2019m not sure if the other parts are being driven well\u2014should I stick my nose into this\nand make sure or just trust somebody\u2019s got it?\u201d Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the\nquality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company\u2019s mission as their mission (we want\nmissionaries, not mercenaries). That\u2019s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors\nversus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they\nown the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable\nfor solving the Whys of their customer experiences.\nFourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It\u2019s a false binary\nto argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still\nbe high quality. We\u2019ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision.\nThe leadership team has to believe it\u2019s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural\nbarriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company\nand culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in\nwhich we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market\nsegments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking",
  "for something better. We spend a lot of time identifying how to unlock these experiences for them as\nquickly as possible, and know if we don\u2019t, somebody else will.\nAnother way to gain speed is to eliminate bureaucracy. There is a difference between process and bureaucracy.\nWhen you\u2019re running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant\nimprovement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get\nlayered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy\nexamples that they were experiencing. I\u2019ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one.\nBuilders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came\nhere to do. As leaders, we don\u2019t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure\nas heck eliminate it when we do. We\u2019ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to\nmove fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.\nFifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got\nstarted. We built Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with 13 people; Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n(EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate\nlarge teams. Historically, we\u2019ve had periods where we\u2019ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it\u2019s not the\nway we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our\nbest leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride\nthemselves on being lean.\nSixth, you have to be willing to take risks. This sounds easier than it is. You need clever enough people to\nidentify worthwhile bets. And if you have these inventive, ambitious builders with high standards, they\u2019re not\nused to failure. They suspect external (and maybe internal) ridicule awaits them if they try something very\ndifferent that doesn\u2019t work out. So, people often play it safe. But, you can\u2019t achieve something extraordinary\nfor customers by playing \u201cnot to lose.\u201d If your Whys take you down an invention path that delivers an\nexperience that doesn\u2019t look like what\u2019s been done before, let customer obsession be your compass. You rarely,\nif ever, change the world by doing the same thing as everybody else.\nAnd finally, you have to care most about delivering compelling results for customers. It\u2019s not how charismatic\nyou are. It\u2019s not whether you\u2019re really good at managing up or sideways. What matters is what we actually\nget done for customers. That\u2019s what we want to reward.\nNext generation Whys\nWhile the team and I feel quite optimistic about the progress and potential of our existing businesses, we\nhave plenty of new Whys we\u2019re asking. Below are a few of them and some quick thoughts.\nWhy is AI so important? Will it really have as much impact as some claim and when?\nGenerative AI is going to reinvent virtually every customer experience we know, and enable altogether new\nones about which we\u2019ve only fantasized. The early AI workloads being deployed focus on productivity and\ncost avoidance (e.g. customer service, business process orchestration, workflow, translation, etc.). This is\nsaving companies a lot of money. Increasingly, you\u2019ll see AI change the norms in coding, search, shopping,\npersonal assistants, primary care, cancer and drug research, biology, robotics, space, financial services,\nneighborhood networks\u2014everything. Some of these areas are already seeing rapid progress; others are still\nin their infancy. But, if your customer experiences aren\u2019t planning to leverage these intelligent models, their\nability to query giant corpuses of data and quickly find your needle in the haystack, their ability to keep\ngetting smarter with more feedback and data, and their future agentic capabilities, you will not be competitive.\nHow soon? It won\u2019t all happen in a year or two, but, it won\u2019t take ten either. It\u2019s moving faster than almost\nanything technology has ever seen.",
  "OK, I buy AI is big; but why invest this much this quickly?\nFundamentally, if your mission is to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day, and you believe every\ncustomer experience will be reinvented by AI, you\u2019re going to invest deeply and broadly in AI. That\u2019s why\nthere are more than 1,000 GenAI applications being built across Amazon, aiming to meaningfully change\ncustomer experiences in shopping, coding, personal assistants, streaming video and music, advertising,\nhealthcare, reading, and home devices, to name a few. It\u2019s also why AWS is quickly developing the key\nprimitives (or building blocks) for AI development, such as custom silicon AI chips in Amazon Trainium to\nprovide better price-performance on training and inference, highly flexible model-building and inference\nservices in Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, our own frontier models in Amazon Nova to provide\nlower cost and latency for customers\u2019 applications, and agent creation and management capabilities.\nThere is also substantial capital investment required. In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more datacenters,\nchips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We\nspend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years (in the case of datacenters, for\nat least 15-20 years). We only start monetizing this capital investment many months after we spend the\ncapital, and over many years\u2014which leads to attractive long-term FCF and ROIC (as people have seen in\nAWS over the last several years). But in periods, like now, of unusually high demand (our AI revenue is\ngrowing at triple digit YoY percentages and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate), you\u2019re\ndeploying a lot of capital. We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we\nknow, the demand is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will\nbe well-served by our investing aggressively now.\nWhy do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?\nAI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won\u2019t be in the future. Chips are the biggest culprit.\nMost AI to date has been built on one chip provider. It\u2019s pricey. Trainium should help, as our new Trainium2\nchips offer 30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally\navailable today. While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference\n(which are the predictions or outputs of the models) will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI\ncost because customers train their models periodically, but produce inferences constantly in large-scale AI\napplications. Inference will become another building block service, along with compute, storage, database,\nand others. We feel strong urgency to make inference less expensive for customers. More price-performant\nchips will help. But, inference will also get meaningfully more efficient in the next couple of years with\nimprovements in model distillation, prompt caching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures.\nReducing the cost per unit in AI will unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire, and also lead\nto more overall AI spending. It\u2019s like what happened with AWS. Revolutionizing the cost of compute and\nstorage happily led to lower cost per unit, and more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute\ninfrastructure spend.\nWhy have personal assistants not yet taken off? How can Alexa help?\nA great personal assistant can answer virtually any question and get things done on your behalf. There have\nbeen no digital solutions that can do both yet. That is, until Alexa+ arrived. Alexa+ is not only comparably\nintelligent to the leading chatbots, but can take a plethora of real actions for you. She can play music, play\nvideo, move media from one of your devices to another, set alarms and timers, control your smart home,\norder across hundreds of millions of ecommerce items, make reservations for restaurants or Ubers, order\nconcert tickets, alert you when your favorite artist announces a tour, find a plumber to fix your sink, and\nmemorize whatever you\u2019ve done on Amazon. This is pretty game-changing for consumers, and just the start of\nwhat Alexa+ will do. We have over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expect Alexa+ to play\nan even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\nWhy can\u2019t we get items to customers even faster? Does it matter?\nEvery year, people ask whether we\u2019ve reached the law of diminishing returns on speed of delivery. Our data\nshows this not to be the case. When we promise faster delivery times, customers complete purchases at a\nmeaningfully higher rate and shop with us more frequently. Amazon Prime started with unlimited, free, two-\nday delivery for a million products; it\u2019s now grown to over 300 million items, with tens of millions available",
  "in one day (or better). An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is\nprimarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and\nthe introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we\u2019ve set speed records for two\nconsecutive years, we\u2019re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don\u2019t forget Prime Air,\nour drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.\nWhy can\u2019t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?\nAs some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we\u2019re going the other\nway\u2014we\u2019re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We\u2019ve already expanded Same-Day and\nOvernight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion\nwill provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less\ndensely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in\n13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.\nRelated, why can\u2019t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?\nThere are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don\u2019t have\naccess to broadband connectivity. They can\u2019t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access\nentertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is\nwhat Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We\u2019re just launching our first\nproduction satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-\nintensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\nWhy does healthcare have to be so stressful?\nHealthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It\u2019s hard to get fast appointments with primary care\nphysicians, often harder with specialists. There\u2019s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes\nwith patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when\nthey get to the pharmacy, they\u2019re often surprised by the pricing, what\u2019s covered by their insurance, and what\nyou can easily access that\u2019s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It\u2019s why you see such\npositive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue\nto iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for\nOne Medical.\nThese are some of the Why questions we\u2019re asking ourselves right now, and I\u2019m excited about the future\ninventions to come. We\u2019re not going to be bored any time soon.\nWhen I first started working, I thought it was unfathomable that my Dad worked at the same place for\n45 years. How could that be? That\u2019s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost\n28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.\nAfter all these years, why are you still at Amazon?\nI\u2019m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I\u2019m not sure\nthat any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow\nthrough. Second, it\u2019s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world\nthan you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and\npeople. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers\nand the company. And, I\u2019ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working,\nand missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of\nqualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their\nbelly, there\u2019s no better place to be than Amazon.",
  "We operate like the world\u2019s largest startup in large part because of our culture of Why. We don\u2019t always get\neverything right, and we learn and iterate like crazy. But, we\u2019re constantly choosing to prioritize customers,\ndelivery, invention, ownership, speed, scrappiness, curiosity, and building a company that outlasts us all. It\nremains Day One.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What\u2019s written there is as true\ntoday as it was in 1997.",
  "1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS\n(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)\nTo our shareholders:\nAmazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers,\nyielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive\ncompetitive entry.\nBut this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the\nvery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,\nhopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive\nlandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings\nand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move\nquickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities\nin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without\nrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\nIt\u2019s All About the Long Term\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate\ndirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on\ninvested capital.\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to\npurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest\naggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an\nenduring franchise.\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making\napproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\n\u2022 We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.\n\u2022 We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\n\u2022 We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work\nbest. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.",
  "\u2022 We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of\ngaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we\nwill have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n\u2022 When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing\nthe present value of future cash flows, we\u2019ll take the cash flows.\n\u2022 We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent\ncompetitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational\nlong-term leadership investments.\n\u2022 We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of\ncontinually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n\u2022 We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.\nAt this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving the\npotential of our business model.\n\u2022 We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to\nweight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largely\naffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,\nand therefore must actually be, an owner.\nWe aren\u2019t so bold as to claim that the above is the \u201cright\u201d investment philosophy, but it\u2019s ours, and we\nwould be remiss if we weren\u2019t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\noutlook for the future.\nObsess Over Customers\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply\ncould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than\nwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-\nto-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged\nfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer\ncustomers gift certificates, 1-ClickSM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth\nremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers\nhave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader\nin online bookselling.\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n\u2022 Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million \u2013 an 838% increase.\n\u2022 Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 \u2013 a 738% increase.\n\u2022 The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\n\u2022 In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\ntop 20.\n\u2022 We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.",
  "Infrastructure\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\n\u2022 Amazon.com\u2019s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\nmanagement team.\n\u2022 Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\n\u2022 Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.\n\u2022 Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\nOur Employees\nThe past year\u2019s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the\nsingle most important element of Amazon.com\u2019s success.\nIt\u2019s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, \u201cYou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\nAmazon.com you can\u2019t choose two out of three\u201d), but we are working to build something important, something\nthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren\u2019t meant to\nbe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion\nbuild Amazon.com.\nGoals for 1998\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.\nThis requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,\nselection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we\nbelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to\nbetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.\nTo be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in\nprioritizing our investments.\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The\nchallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:\naggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of\nproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market\nopportunity. However, as we\u2019ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to\nbe a very large market, and it\u2019s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about\nwhat we\u2019ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\nJeffrey P. Bezos\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.",

Actual results and outcomes may differ \nmaterially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I \u2014 \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As used herein, \n\u201cAmazon.com,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates \notherwise.\nGeneral\nWe seek to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than \ncompetitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our \nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, \nadvertisers, and employees.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services \n(\u201cAWS\u201d). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. \nInformation on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 10 \u2014 \nSegment Information.\u201d\nConsumers\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design \nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product \ncategories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically \nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, \nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-\nto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a \nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, \nlive sports, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks \nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. \nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, \n\u201cProperties.\u201d\nSellers\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using \nour services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity \nfees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\nDevelopers and Enterprises\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, \nthrough AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and \nmachine learning, and other services. \nContent Creators\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app \ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content.\nAdvertisers\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored \nads, display, and video advertising.\n3",
  "Competition\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide \nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from \nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and \nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to \nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and \nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual \nassistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in \ncollaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, \nomnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment \nprocessing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or \noffline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based \ninfrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, \nmarket, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery \nproducts online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and \n(10) providers of virtual or in-person healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail \nbusinesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for \nour seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019 \nability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, \nlonger histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. \nThey may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that \nrestrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive \nterms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive \nentry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. \nEach of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and \nwell-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their \ncompetitive positions.\nIntellectual Property\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary \ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, \ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to \nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain \nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications \ncovering certain of our proprietary technology. \nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, \nwhich ends December 31. \nHuman Capital\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2024, we \nemployed approximately 1,556,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and \ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software \nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for \npersonnel across other parts of our business.\nWe strive to be Earth\u2019s best employer. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement this objective and \ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills \ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees). Over 240,000",
  "Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the \nmechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at \nAmazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety \ncontrols, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex \nproblems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and \nhave deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\n4",

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may \nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, \nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, \nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by \nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant \nrisks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of \nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and \nadditional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. \nMany of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a \nmaterial adverse effect on us.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe Face Intense Competition\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, \nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, \nhealthcare, communications, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have \ngreater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched \nproducts and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive \npricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and \nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in \nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including \nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital \ncontent, satellites, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and \ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result \nof competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may \nbe required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or \nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if \ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or \nquality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, \nand we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often \nsignificant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the \n6",
  "value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for \na variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully \nplan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In \ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and \npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of \nrisks, including:\n\u2022\nlocal economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive \ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and \ntariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); \nnationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, \nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal \nprecedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media \nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nbusiness licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, electronic devices, and \ncommunications services;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022\nlimited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\nshorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, \nconsumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\u2022\nlower levels of use of the internet;\n\u2022\nlower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural \ndifferences;\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting \ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\u2022\nlaws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will \nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive \nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local \nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d) and India regulate Amazon\u2019s and its affiliates\u2019 businesses and operations in \ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT \ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products \nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide \ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide \nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online \nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a \nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing \n7",
  "laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in \ntheir regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial \nuncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will \nultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to \ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships \nwe or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the \ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other \nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. \nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising \nrevenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade \nrestrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors \nnegatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, \npromotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary \nfears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a \nresult of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur \nduring our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet \ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be \nrequired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce \nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and \nadditional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our \nwebsites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites \nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the \nattractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and \ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-\nsourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network \noptimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \nbalances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing \nactivities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there \nis also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. \nOur accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, \nresulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have \nin the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we \nmaintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers \nnever receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers\u2019 descriptions, \nand to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling \ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When",
  "these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation \nand we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may \nreimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of \nthis program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. \nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing \nIntellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and \nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret \nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary \nrights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made \navailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. \nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be \n8",
  "unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our \ntrademarks and other proprietary rights.\nWe are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions \ntaken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or \nreputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. \nMoreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third \nparties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently \ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged \ninfringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, \nand may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or \nsignificant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who \nallege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks \nhave been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and \nour customers\u2019 development and use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, \nincluding those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital \ncontent. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and \ncontent providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and \nproduct and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may \ndiffer materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany \nbalances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also \nhold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and \nJapanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \nbalances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\nOperating Risks\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service \nofferings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our \nbusiness can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial \nresources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage \ngrowth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales \nestimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending \nquickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating \nprofit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our \nbusiness is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of \ndemand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in \ndecreased revenue or growth.\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in \nthis section and the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers\u2019 \ndemands;\n\u2022",
  "demands;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\n9",
  "\u2022\nchanges in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, web services, satellite \ncommunications services, and artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, products, and services, \nincluding outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\ntiming, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\n\u2022\nthe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief \nand could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations in the mix of products and services we sell;\n\u2022\nvariations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional \nbenefits to our customers;\n\u2022\nfactors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or \ncommitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions \nregarding our positions on social or ethical issues and our development and use of artificial intelligence, machine \nlearning, and automation technologies, products, and services;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\n\u2022\navailability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy, \ncommodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, \nincluding as a result of inflationary pressures;\n\u2022\nconstrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant \nour customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to \ncustomize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of \nservice attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking, \nwhich has been critical to our growth and success;\n\u2022\ndisruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a \nresult of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and \npolitical conflicts, including those involving China), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental \nactions impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries), \ntariff policy changes, and similar events; and\n\u2022\npotential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme \nweather events or climate-related changes, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment \nrequirements associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy; decreased demand for our products and \nservices as a result of changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global \nregulations and third-party requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental \nimpact.\nWe Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers\nFailures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our \nfulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center \ncapacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As \nwe continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and \ndata center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance \nthat we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\n10",
  "In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping \ncost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-\nsourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity \nacross our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it \ndifficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would \nlike. \nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the \ncomplexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for \nstorage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory \nfulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to \noptimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An \ninability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties \nexperienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and \nrelated costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound \ninventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused \ndisasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and \nsecurity issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Incidents\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, \nproprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized \naccess, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\u2019 or customers\u2019 technology, products, and \nsystems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our \noperating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data \nprotection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, \nand services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of \nreasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to \ncustomers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security incidents, and, \nalthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will \nnot have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that \nare designed to protect customer data and prevent, detect, or mitigate such incidents, including systems and processes designed \nto reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security \nand may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to \nrespond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which \nmay reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, \nupgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to \navoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or \ninterrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather \n(including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed \nhostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and",
  "similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could \nprevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service \nofferings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may \nnot be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these \nevents could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel \nCould Negatively Affect Our Business\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have \u201ckey \nperson\u201d life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the \nindustries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience \n11",
  "significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical \nstaff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our \nemployees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies\u2019 policies, which could negatively impact our \nability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to \nsuccessfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry \nout our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain \nour operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and \nregulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, \ndecrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our \nworkforce.\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational \nefforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our \nresponse to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of \nsupply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and \ncontent. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, \ncomponents, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit \nor stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, \nincluding as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-\ncaused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to \nprocure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we \nrely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence \ninfrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our \nability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers \nor other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain \nStandards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our \nreputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through \ncommercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, \ntechnology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services \nthrough our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other \nresource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, \nand develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, \ninventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third \nparties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially \ndependent on the volume of the other company\u2019s sales. Therefore, when the other company\u2019s offerings are not successful, the \ncompensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to \nenter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject \nto claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or",
  "developing these services.\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We \nmay in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their \ncontractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such \nas:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022\nimpairment of other relationships;\n\u2022\nvariability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\n12",
  "Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint \nventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\n\u2022\nproblems retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nadditional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or \nour own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing \nconditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; \n\u2022\nthe difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated \nexpenses related to such integration;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of integrating a new company\u2019s accounting, financial and sustainability reporting, management, \ninformation and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and \nthe lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;\n\u2022\nlosses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\u2019s \nfinancial performance into our financial results;\n\u2022\nfor investments in which an investee\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or \nin part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the \ndependence on the investee\u2019s accounting, financial and sustainability reporting, and similar systems, controls, and \nprocesses;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger \npublic company;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the \nrisks our other businesses face;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\u2022\nfor foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and \nlanguages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur \ndebt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and \nharm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and \nstrategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-\nthan-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us \nand third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of \nseasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer \ndemand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. \nWe endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. \nDemand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of \nsale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to \nestablish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The \nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be \nreturnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at \ntimes we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of \nthe inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.\n13",
  "We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional \nfinancing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, checks, and payment upon delivery. \nFor existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to \nadditional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that \ncould result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment \nmethods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our \noperating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and \npayment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. \nIn each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We \nalso offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable \nterms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification \nrequirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or \nimpossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure \nto otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card \nissuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments \nfrom our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and \noperating results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances \nwith us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their \nbehalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, \nhandling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We \nare also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, \ninternational money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer \nprotection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be \nsubject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\nWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response \nto, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; \n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\n\u2022\ntransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, social media activity, and \nspeculation.\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our \ncash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results \nor reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the \ninternet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial",
  "intelligence technologies and services, satellite communications services, healthcare, and other products and services that we \noffer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, \nnetwork security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, communications, electronic \ndevice certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts \n14",
  "and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online \npayment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services \nor access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, \nlegality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, \nhealthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data \nuse, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our \noperations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence \ntechnologies and services, satellite communications services, and healthcare. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our \noperations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses \nexpand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and \nregulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our \noperations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe \ncompetition or consumer protection rules, including aspects of Amazon\u2019s operation of its stores, including its fulfillment \nnetwork and Prime, and certain aspects of AWS\u2019s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to \ndefend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and \nregulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to \nuncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly \nfocused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to \nbe online \u201cgatekeepers\u201d through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, \nwhich increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or \ninterpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or \nenforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil \nand criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our \nproducts and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially \nadverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The \nmedia, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. \nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of \nOperations\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we \nare regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including \nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual \nproperty matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, \nprivacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, \ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), healthcare, and \nother matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope \nand geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more \npeople, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating \na number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state \nattorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us \nbecause of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors.",
  "The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves \nor possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable \noutcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such \namounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a \nmaterial effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible \nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, \nconsent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or \nservices, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of \nnon-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on \nour operations. \nWe Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or \nManufacture\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal \ninjury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who \nsell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, \n15",
  "we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party \nseller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain \nliability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will \ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that \nare intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for \nbreaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from \nproduct liability.\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign \njurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for \ntax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to \ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. \nSuch changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions \nare considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, \ntargeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect \nsales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result \nin liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising \nand marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader \ninternational tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we \noperate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense.\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or \nretroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to \nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government \nagencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly \ncomply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, \ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, \nlosses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or \nextraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income \nand loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the \nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is \nuncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. \nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash \nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the \ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, \nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially \ndifferent from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to \nAmazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay \nadditional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we",
  "believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be \nmaterially different from our historical tax accruals.\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement \nregulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and \ninvestigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and \nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment \nof fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to \nperiodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\nItem 1B.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNone. \n16",
  "Item 1C.\nCybersecurity\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from potential unauthorized \noccurrences on or through our electronic information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or \navailability of our information systems or the information residing on those systems. These include a wide variety of \nmechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data \nloss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include \nconfidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our \nbusiness, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security \nincident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from \ncybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use \nfor encryption and authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.  \nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, \npenetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are \nutilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate \nemployees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing \nand maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership \nand other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of experienced chief information security \nofficers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained \ncybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors, \nconsultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks. \nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise \nrisk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also \nsubject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we \nface is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d under the heading \u201cWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security \nIncidents,\u201d which should be read in conjunction with the information above.\nThe Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for \nprotecting our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and \nrelated risks. The Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management, including our chief security \nofficer, and reports to the Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board\u2019s response to any significant \ncybersecurity incidents. \nOur chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work \nexperience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior \nexecutive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data \nprotection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n17",

All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, \nindustry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-\nlooking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. \nActual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional \nlabor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and \nemerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, \nthe mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the \nextent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, \ninternational growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, \nfulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree \nto which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic \ntransactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical \nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. \nThese risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ \nsignificantly from management\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered \nthrough our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, \nand we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from \nitems we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as \nservice sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product \ncategories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, \nand digital content subscriptions.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by \nincreasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital \nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily \nresult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by \ninvestments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer \nexperience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including \nlowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original \ncontent, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving \nreliability, and earning customer trust. See \u201cResults of Operations \u2014 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for additional \ninformation on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product \nand content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, \ntransportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs \ninclude the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online \nstores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs",
  "generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, \ngeographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to \nlower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our \nprocesses. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. \nBecause consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect \nvariability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales \nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, \nsupply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent \nto which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over \ntime since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix \n20",
  "of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and \ntiming of payment terms with suppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, \nsoftware and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital \nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-\nfunctionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, \nincluding AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to \nenhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the \nspeed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical \napplications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users\u2019 experience on the internet and \nincrease its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in \nAWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine \nlearning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy \ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite \nnetwork for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, \nsuch as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. We utilize restricted stock \nunits as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests \nof our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards \noutstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.8 billion \nand 10.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our \nreported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our \ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained \nconstant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our \nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our \nincreasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders \nover the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of \ncurrency changes.\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the \neffect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either \npositively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and \nSupplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\u201d\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 includes a discussion and analysis of our \nfinancial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s \nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States \n(\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, \nand related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical \naccounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation \nuncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of \nthe Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have",
  "other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to \nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 \nNote 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\u201d Although we believe that our \nestimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may \ndiffer significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and \nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently \navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \n21",
  "vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future \ndisposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material \nwrite-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of \nDecember 31, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $365 million.\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These \ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, \nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or \nwithout notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and \nestimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of \nbusiness for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to \nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use \nour deferred tax assets. \nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, \ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, \nincluding earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated \nin jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related \ntax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to \nour forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and \nliabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to \ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In \naddition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate \nmultinationals. \nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional \nincome tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect \non our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and \nsubsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the \nadequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, \nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$ \n84,946 $ \n115,877 \nInvesting activities\n \n(49,833)  \n(94,342) \nFinancing activities\n \n(15,879)  \n(11,812) \nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and \nmarketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $86.8 billion and $101.2 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. \nAmounts held in foreign currencies were $23.5 billion and $25.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our foreign \ncurrency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. \nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $84.9 billion and $115.9 billion in 2023 and 2024. Our operating cash \nflows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and \nadvertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and \nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities \ngenerally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2024, compared to the prior year, was due to an \nincrease in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific",
  "point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the \ntiming of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold \nimprovements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for \n22",
  "acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable \nsecurities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(49.8) billion and $(94.3) billion in 2023 and 2024, with the \nvariability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash \ncapital expenditures were $48.1 billion, and $77.7 billion in 2023 and 2024, which primarily reflect investments in technology \ninfrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment \nnetwork. We expect cash capital expenditures to increase in 2025, primarily driven by investments in technology infrastructure. \nWe made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $5.8 billion and $7.1 \nbillion in 2023 and 2024. We funded the acquisition of 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In Q3 \n2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a convertible note from Anthropic, PBC. In Q1 2024, we invested $2.75 billion in a second \nconvertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a third convertible note, and will invest \nan additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025.\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(15.9) billion and $(11.8) billion in 2023 and 2024. Cash inflows \nfrom financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $18.1 billion and $5.1 \nbillion in 2023 and 2024. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-\nterm debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $34.0 billion and $17.0 billion in 2023 and 2024. Property and \nequipment acquired under finance leases was $642 million and $854 million in 2023 and 2024.\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs \nas of December 31, 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 6 \u2014 Debt\u201d for \nadditional information. \nAs of December 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $6.3 \nbillion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, \nindefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of \nsuch amounts.\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized \nresearch and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to \nexpense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually \nfrom 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included accelerated depreciation deductions for 2022, 2023, and 2024. \nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for \nU.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income \ntaxes (net of refunds) totaled $11.2 billion and $12.3 billion for 2023 and 2024. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $503 million and \n$3.5 billion. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 6 \u2014 Debt\u201d and \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 7 \u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\u201d for additional discussion of our principal \ncontractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, \nincluding for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve \nmonths. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual \nprovisions.\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, \nas well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next \ntwelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See \nItem 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit \nfacilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay \ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial \nposition.",
  "position. \nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, \nfrom time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital \ninfrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or \nissue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be \navailable in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking \nbodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in \nour borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. \n23",
  "Results of Operations\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect \nthe way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial \nStatements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 10 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d \nOverview\nMacroeconomic factors, including changes in inflation and interest rates, global economic and geopolitical developments, \nand the development and adoption of technologies and services, including artificial intelligence, have direct and indirect \nimpacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. These could affect customer demand for our \nproducts and services, our ability to predict growth needs, expenses, and the benefits we gain from new technologies. We \nexpect some or all of them to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2025.\nNet Sales\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping \nfees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which \nincludes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime \nmembership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nNet Sales:\nNorth America\n$ 352,828 \n$ 387,497 \nInternational\n \n131,200 \n \n142,906 \nAWS\n \n90,757 \n \n107,556 \nConsolidated\n$ 574,785 \n$ 637,959 \nYear-over-year Percentage Growth:\nNorth America\n 12 %\n 10 %\nInternational\n 11 \n 9 \nAWS\n 13 \n 19 \nConsolidated\n 12 \n 11 \nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\nNorth America\n 12 %\n 10 %\nInternational\n 11 \n 10 \nAWS\n 13 \n 19 \nConsolidated\n 12 \n 11 \nNet Sales Mix:\nNorth America\n 61 %\n 61 %\nInternational\n 23 \n 22 \nAWS\n 16 \n 17 \nConsolidated\n 100 %\n 100 %\nSales increased 11% in 2024, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales by \n$2.3 billion in 2024. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange \nRates\u201d below.\nNorth America sales increased 10% in 2024, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased \nunit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven \nlargely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. \nChanges in foreign exchange rates reduced North America net sales by $462 million in 2024.\nInternational sales increased 9% in 2024, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit \nsales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely \nby our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. Changes \nin foreign exchange rates reduced International net sales by $1.8 billion in 2024.\n24",
  "AWS sales increased 19% in 2024, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer \nusage, partially offset by pricing changes primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.\nOperating Expenses\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n  \n2023\n2024\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of sales\n$ 304,739 \n$ 326,288 \nFulfillment\n \n90,619 \n \n98,505 \nTechnology and infrastructure\n \n85,622 \n \n88,544 \nSales and marketing\n \n44,370 \n \n43,907 \nGeneral and administrative\n \n11,816 \n \n11,359 \nOther operating expense (income), net\n \n767 \n \n763 \nTotal operating expenses\n$ 537,933 \n$ 569,366 \nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\nCost of sales\n 6 %\n 7 %\nFulfillment\n 7 \n 9 \nTechnology and infrastructure\n 17 \n 3 \nSales and marketing\n 5 \n (1) \nGeneral and administrative\n (1) \n (4) \nOther operating expense (income), net\n (39) \n (1) \nPercent of Net Sales:\nCost of sales\n 53.0 %\n 51.1 %\nFulfillment\n 15.8 \n 15.4 \nTechnology and infrastructure\n 14.9 \n 13.9 \nSales and marketing\n 7.7 \n 6.9 \nGeneral and administrative\n 2.1 \n 1.8 \nOther operating expense (income), net\n 0.1 \n 0.1 \nCost of Sales\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, \nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media \ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.\nThe increase in cost of sales in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs \nresulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies, including lower transportation costs. Changes \nin foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $1.7 billion in 2024.\nShipping costs were $89.5 billion and $95.8 billion in 2023 and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our \nsuppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our \ncost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we \nuse more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part \nthrough achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and \nachieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future \nsuccess, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and infrastructure\u201d as we leverage a shared \ninfrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\nFulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International \nfulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment \n25",
  "processing and related transaction costs are included in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d AWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and \ninfrastructure.\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and \nrelated transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and \nfulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and \nphysical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, \nand our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements \nto our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction \ncosts as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase \nprice of underlying transactions.\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and investments \nin our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced \nfulfillment costs by $223 million in 2024.\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet \nanticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the \nfulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\nTechnology and Infrastructure\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and \ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and \ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include \nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses \nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to \noffer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy \ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service \nand autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the \ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever \nincreasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product \nand service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect \nspending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs \nare allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in 2024, compared to the prior \nyear, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by decreased payroll and related costs \nassociated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new \nproducts and service offerings and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful \nlife of our servers. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $244 million in 2024. We \ncurrently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband \nservice (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain \nof these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers. \nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and \nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of \nmarketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television \nadvertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the \nextent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we \nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.",
  "would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to decreased payroll and \nrelated expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by increased advertising expenses. \nChanges in foreign exchange rates reduced sales and marketing costs by $263 million in 2024.\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and \nmarketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them \nindefinitely.\n26",
  "General and Administrative\nThe decrease in general and administrative costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to a decrease in \npayroll and related expenses.\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net was $767 million and $763 million during 2023 and 2024, and was primarily \nrelated to asset impairments and the amortization of intangible assets.\nOperating Income (Loss) \nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023\n2024\nOperating Income (Loss)\nNorth America\n$ \n14,877 $ \n24,967 \nInternational\n \n(2,656)  \n3,792 \nAWS\n \n24,631  \n39,834 \nConsolidated\n$ \n36,852 $ \n68,593 \nOperating income was $36.9 billion and $68.6 billion for 2023 and 2024. We believe that operating income is a more \nmeaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. For more \ninformation on the operating expenses that impact segment operating income, see \u201cOperating Expenses\u201d and the descriptions of \noperating expense line item changes on pages 25 to 27, and \u201cNote 10 \u2014 Segment Information\u201d on page 65.\nThe increase in North America operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit \nsales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs.\nThe International operating income in 2024, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to \nincreased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs. Changes in \nforeign exchange rates did not significantly impact operating income in 2024. \nThe increase in AWS operating income in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, decreased \npayroll and related expenses, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful \nlives of our servers, partially offset by spending on technology infrastructure that was primarily driven by additional \ninvestments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by \n$240 million in 2024.\nInterest Income and Expense\nOur interest income was $2.9 billion and $4.7 billion during 2023 and 2024, primarily due to a higher average balance of \ninvested funds at prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term \nmarketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of \ninvested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are \ninvested.\nInterest expense was $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2023 and 2024 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. \nSee Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Leases and Note 6 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional \ninformation.\nOur long-term lease liabilities were $77.3 billion and $78.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. Our long-term \ndebt was $58.3 billion and $52.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. See Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and \nSupplementary Data \u2014 Note 4 \u2014 Leases and Note 6 \u2014 Debt\u201d for additional information.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was $938 million and $(2.3) billion during 2023 and 2024. The primary components of other \nincome (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign \ncurrency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2023 and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of \n$797 million and $(1.6) billion from our equity investment in Rivian.\n27",
  "Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and \ntaxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special \ntax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock \nprice, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, \nregulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global \ntax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or \nlosses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-\ntax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater \nwhen our pre-tax income is lower.

  "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the \nmarket values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth \nbelow and in Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 \nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our \nlong-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. \nHowever, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of \ninterest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.  \nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-\nrated money market funds. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely \naffected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in \nmarket value due to changes in interest rates.

  "Foreign Exchange Risk\nDuring 2024, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and \nrelated expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in \nour North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily \ninclude Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances \nassociated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon \nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and \nwe may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of \nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net \nsales decreased by $1.8 billion in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign \nfunds\u201d). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2024, of $25.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% \nadverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.3 billion, $2.6 billion, and $5.1 billion. \nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on \nthe intercompany balances as of December 31, 2024, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates \nwould result in losses of $305 million, $605 million, and $1.2 billion, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense), net.\u201d\nSee Item 7 of Part II, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \u2014 \nResults of Operations \u2014 Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of \nchanges in foreign exchange rates.\nEquity Investment Risk\nAs of December 31, 2024, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and \nprivate companies was $22.1 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include \nour equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.6 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2024, and are recorded at fair \nvalue, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value \nand adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-\nfor-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic, PBC. Valuations \nof private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic \nconditions provide additional uncertainty.

  "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, \n2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash \nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \n\u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, \nthe financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for \neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm \nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that \nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the \nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, \nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n34",
  "Uncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of\nthe Matter\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income \ntaxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are \nmany tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment \nis required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The \nCompany uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more \nlikely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $6.5 billion for various tax \ncontingencies.\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because \nthe evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the \nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management\u2019s \nevaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted \nby regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.\nHow We \nAddressed the \nMatter in Our \nAudit\nWe tested controls over the Company\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, \nincluding controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; \nthe measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the \ndevelopment of the related disclosures. \nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in \nassessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the \nspecific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our \nprocedures included obtaining and examining the Company\u2019s analysis including the Company\u2019s \ncorrespondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions \nare based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income \ntax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company\u2019s accounting for its tax \ncontingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential \neffects on the Company\u2019s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the \nappropriateness of the Company\u2019s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company\u2019s calculations and data \nused to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize.

  "AMAZON.COM, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2014 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\nDescription of Business\nWe seek to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, \nconsisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers \nthrough our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to \ngrow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, \nindependent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell \ncontent. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology \nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and \nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \u201cNote 10 \u2014 \nSegment Information.\u201d \nCommon Stock Split\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of \nauthorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d), and per share or per RSU information throughout \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a \npar value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split \nwas reclassified from \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\u201d to \u201cCommon stock.\u201d\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities \n(collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable \ninterest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our \nhealthcare services. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the \nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the \nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives \nof equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation \nforfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and \noperating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video \ncontent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing \nbasis. \nIn Q4 2024, we completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment and are increasing the useful life from \nten years to thirteen years for such equipment effective January 1, 2025. Based on heavy equipment included in \u201cProperty and \nequipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2024, we estimate an increase in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.9 billion, \nwhich will be recorded primarily in \u201cFulfillment\u201d and impact our North America and International segments.\nWe completed our most recent servers and networking equipment useful life study in Q4 2024, and are changing the \nuseful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment, effective January 1, 2025, from six years to five years. For \nthose assets included in \u201cProperty and equipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2024, whose useful life will change from six years \nto five years, we anticipate a decrease in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.7 billion. We expect to continue to acquire \nmore of these server and networking assets in 2025. In 2024, we also determined, primarily in the fourth quarter, to retire early \ncertain of our servers and networking equipment. We recorded approximately $920 million of accelerated depreciation and \nrelated charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to these decisions. The accelerated depreciation will continue \ninto 2025 and decrease operating income by approximately $0.6 billion in 2025. These two changes above are due to an \nincreased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.",
  "We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from five years to six years effective January 1, 2024. The \neffect of this change for the year ended December 31, 2024, based on servers that were included in \u201cProperty and equipment, \n41",
  "net\u201d as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation \nand amortization expense of $3.2 billion and a benefit to net income of $2.5 billion, or $0.23 per basic share and $0.23 per \ndiluted share.\nThese server and networking equipment useful life changes primarily impact our AWS segment. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in \nthe fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These \ncharges were recorded in \u201cOther operating expense (income), net\u201d and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the \nyear ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately $480 million, primarily in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d primarily \nrelating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily \nimpacted our North America segment.      \nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in \nthe fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded \nprimarily in \u201cTechnology and infrastructure,\u201d \u201cFulfillment,\u201d and \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d and primarily impacted our \nNorth America segment.\nCharges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not \nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\n2024\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest\n$ \n1,561 $ \n2,608 $ \n1,858 \nCash paid for operating leases\n$ \n8,633 $ \n10,453 $ \n12,341 \nCash paid for interest on finance leases\n$ \n374 $ \n308 $ \n287 \nCash paid for interest on financing obligations\n$ \n207 $ \n196 $ \n219 \nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds\n$ \n6,035 $ \n11,179 $ \n12,308 \nAssets acquired under operating leases\n$ \n18,800 $ \n14,052 $ \n15,424 \nProperty and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and \nmodifications\n$ \n675 $ \n642 $ \n854 \nProperty and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease \narrangements\n$ \n3,187 $ \n357 $ \n97 \nProperty and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease \narrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating\n$ \n5,158 $ \n1,374 $ \n\u2014 \nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares.

  "Revenue\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return \nallowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, \nincluding sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is \nallocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone \nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. \nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of \nthe goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an \nAmazon delivery, to the customer.\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders \nusing our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and \nshipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon \ndelivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. \nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through \nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the \nnumber of clicks or impressions.\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to \ncontent including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime \nmemberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. \nSubscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized \nover the subscription period.\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is \nallocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based \non the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including \ncompute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales \ncommissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and \ndistribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when \ncontent is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\nReturn Allowances \nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for \nreturn allowances are included in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d and were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.4 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion and deductions \nfrom the allowance were $5.2 billion, $5.1 billion, and $5.5 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Included in \u201cInventories\u201d on our \nconsolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $948 million, $992 million, and $998 million as of December 31, 2022, 2023, \nand 2024, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. \nCost of Sales\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, \nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media \ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers \nare included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and \nrelated transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in \u201cFulfillment\u201d on our consolidated \nstatements of operations.\nVendor Agreements\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, \nincentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we \npay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost",
  "of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We \nevaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates \ncan be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\n43",
  "Fulfillment\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International \nsegments\u2019 fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such \nas depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; \npicking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including \ncosts associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain \nmanagement for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us \nin fulfillment and customer service operations.\nTechnology and Infrastructure\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and \ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and \ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include \nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses \nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to \noffer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy \ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service \nand autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and \nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer \nreferrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third \nparties.\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $20.6 \nbillion, $20.3 billion, and $21.4 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024. \nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related \nexpenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant \nand recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares \ngranted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of \nestimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is \nrecognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated \nmethod also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, \nthe adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The \nestimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated \nestimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates \nare revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience. \nAdditionally, we have stock-based compensation awards that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are \nremeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. \nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and asset impairments.  \n44",
  "Other Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022\n2023\n2024\nMarketable equity securities valuation gains (losses)\n$ (13,870) $ \n984 $ (1,278) \nEquity warrant valuation gains (losses)\n \n(2,132)  \n26  \n(192) \nUpward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies\n \n76  \n40  \n49 \nForeign currency gains (losses)\n \n(340)  \n65  \n(408) \nOther, net\n \n(540)  \n(177)  \n(421) \nTotal other income (expense), net\n$ (16,806) $ \n938 $ (2,250) \nIncluded in other income (expense), net in 2022, 2023, and 2024 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of \n$(12.7) billion, $797 million, and $(1.6) billion from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (\u201cRivian\u201d). Our \ninvestment in Rivian\u2019s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or \nimpairments, prior to Rivian\u2019s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock \nto Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2024, we held 158 million shares of Rivian\u2019s Class A common stock, \nrepresenting an approximate 14% ownership interest, and an approximate 13% voting interest. We determined that we have the \nability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the \npurchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian\u2019s board of \ndirectors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \u201cMarketable \nsecurities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $3.7 billion and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \nDecember 31, 2024. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability \nof approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and \nlosses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We \nintend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely \noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such \namounts.  \nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates \nexpected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are \nevaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We \nconsider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative \nloss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods \navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. \nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). \nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is \nmore likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The \nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate \nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require \nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our \nincome tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the \nfollowing hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 \u2014 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n45",
  "Level 2 \u2014 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted \nprices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities \nin markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 \u2014 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably \navailable assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in \nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of \nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from \nor corroborated by observable market data. \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and \nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently \navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, \nrepresenting a write-down of inventory, was $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers\u2019 programs. Third-party sellers \nmaintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and \ntherefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to \nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead \ntimes and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain \nelectronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These \ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\nIncluded in \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to \ncustomers, vendors, and prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, customer receivables, \nnet, were $34.1 billion and $34.3 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion, and other receivables, net, \nwere $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion. Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which include amounts related to non-income \ntaxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $5.4 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and \nDecember 31, 2024. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to \u201cTechnology and \ninfrastructure.\u201d \nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. \nReceivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected \nin accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, and $2.0 \nbillion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Additions to the allowance were $1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.9 billion, \nand deductions to the allowance were $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use \nsoftware, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, \nincluding those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. \nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from \nproperty and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, \nalong with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the \nconstruction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment,",
  "heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the \nestimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, five years \n46",
  "prior to January 1, 2024 and six years subsequent to January 1, 2024 for our servers, six years for our networking equipment, \nten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is \nclassified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. \nLeases\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are \ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired \nunder finance leases are recorded in \u201cProperty and equipment, net.\u201d All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our \nleases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of \nproperty, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are \naccounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone \nprices.\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a \ndiscount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present \nvalue of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease \nprepayments reclassified from \u201cOther assets\u201d upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and \namortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase \nthe leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the \nclassification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes \nin price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. \nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the \nterm of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \nestimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. \nThe interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method \nover the lease term.\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the \ntermination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded \nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\nFinancing Obligations\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have \ncontrol over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the \narrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful \nlife or the term of the obligation. \nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are \nderecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. \nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event \noccurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative \nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset \nis less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and \nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, \nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash \nflows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily \non expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible",
  "assets as of April 1, 2024, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their \ncarrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See \u201cNote 5 \u2014 Acquisitions, \nGoodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.\u201d\n47",
  "Other Assets\nIncluded in \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, \nnet of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; \nconvertible notes and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We \nrecognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, \nsuch as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are \nrecorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\nDigital Video and Music Content\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing \nagreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the \nlicense fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we \nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we \namortize the asset to \u201cCost of sales\u201d on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line \nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are \nexpensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \n\u201cCost of sales\u201d predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. \nThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns \nimpacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. \nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each \nmajor geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an \nevent occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of \nvideo, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. \nTotal video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video \nand music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, \nand costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-\nrated money market funds. Such investments are included in \u201cCash and cash equivalents\u201d or \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on the \naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.  \nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses \nincluded in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\u201d Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair \nvalue below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a \nforecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d on our \nconsolidated statements of operations.\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair \nvalue option, are included in \u201cMarketable securities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with \nchanges recognized in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nNotes that are convertible to equity classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and \nlosses included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\u201d Credit losses, if any, are recorded as an allowance \nthrough \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. Upon conversion, the amount of the notes \nreported at fair value are reclassified generally from available-for-sale to equity investments accounted for at cost, with any \nassociated unrealized gain or loss reclassified from \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d to \u201cOther income \n(expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. \nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. In Q1 2024, we \ninvested $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. In Q4 2024, we entered into an agreement and invested $1.3 billion in a",
  "third convertible note, and will invest an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025. The notes are classified as available-for-sale and \nare classified as Level 3 assets, and as of December 31, 2024 had an estimated fair value of approximately $13.8 billion. In \nmaking these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of \nthe convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates \nof expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, a portion of the notes were converted to nonvoting preferred stock. As a result of this \nconversion, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and \n48",
  "a gain will be recorded in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d in our Q1 2025 consolidated statement of operations. We also have a \ncommercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips.\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are \naccounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments recognized in \u201cOther income (expense), \nnet\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate \nwhether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/\nacquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its \nestimated fair value. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, these investments had a carrying value of $754 million and $989 \nmillion.\nEquity investments where we can exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are accounted for using \nthe equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported \nby equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in \n\u201cEquity-method investment activity, net of tax\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we \nevaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment \nto its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, these investments had a carrying value of $614 million and $1.2 \nbillion.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, equity warrants measured at fair value were $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion, with \nchanges recognized in \u201cOther income (expense), net\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are \nclassified as Level 2 and 3 assets. \nThese non-marketable investments are included within \u201cOther assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain of our investments represent a variable interest in an entity. We do not consolidate the entities in which we hold \nthese investments because we are not the primary beneficiary. \nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that \nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a \nsignificant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate \nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset\u2019s carrying \namount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss \nbased on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale \nwhen certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for \nsale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at \nthe lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nAccrued Expenses and Other\nIncluded in \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to tax-\nrelated liabilities, leases and asset retirement obligations, self-insurance liabilities, payroll and related expenses, current debt, \nunredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and $7.5 billion and our \nliabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.3 billion and $5.4 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by \na customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-\ninsure for exposure primarily related to workers\u2019 compensation, employee healthcare benefits, general and product liability, and \nautomobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance",
  "liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, \nand other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, \nassociated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth \nquarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by \nchanges in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in \u201cCost of sales\u201d on \nour consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Increases to our reserves driven by \n49",
  "changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and \n2024. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, our total self-insurance liabilities were $6.3 billion and $8.5 billion and are included \nin \u201cAccrued expenses and other\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.  \nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is \nrecognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime \nmemberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.9 billion, of which $14.2 billion was recognized as \nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $24.6 billion. \nIncluded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $5.7 billion and $6.5 billion of unearned \nrevenue as of December 31, 2023 and 2024. \nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer \ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that \nexceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $177 billion as of December 31, 2024. The \nweighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.1 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue \nrecognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nIncluded in \u201cOther long-term liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing \nobligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, deferred tax liabilities, and digital video and \nmusic content.\nForeign Currency\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly \nincurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that \neither operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency.

  "Suppliers\nDuring 2024, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or \narrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit \nlimits.\nOther Contingencies\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to \nvarious non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in \nwhich we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of \nproducts and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with \nthird parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) \nthe adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent \ncomplexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome \nof any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:\nIn May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, \nInc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleged, among other things, that \n\u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface \nUsing Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint sought an injunction, an unspecified amount of \ndamages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in \ntheir damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in \ndamages. In March 2024, the district court granted summary judgment ruling that the patent is invalid and dismissed the case. \nIn April 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend \nourselves vigorously in this matter.\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleged, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe \nU.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled \u201cNetwork Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol\u201d; and \n7,233,978, entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which \nthe Location Information Pertains.\u201d The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 \nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In April 2024, a jury found that Amazon infringed the asserted patents and awarded \nKove $525 million in damages. In August 2024, the court awarded Kove $148 million in pre-judgment interest. In September \n2024, we filed a notice of appeal. We disagree with the jury\u2019s findings and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this \nmatter. \nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Illinois (\u201cN.D. Ill.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, \nincluding Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon\u2019s collection, storage, use, \nretention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege \npurported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including \nAmazon Photos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon\u2019s Flex driver app, and Amazon\u2019s virtual try-on \ntechnology. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys\u2019 \nfees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Washington (\u201cW.D. Wash.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, \namong other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s \nstores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys \nGeneral for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior",
  "Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the \nprivate cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through \nAmazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The \ncomplaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, \nattorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in \nSeptember 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. \nThat complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace \n59",
  "services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, \nadvertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive \nand structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. In May 2024, the Attorney General of Arizona filed a \ncomplaint in the Superior Court of Arizona in Maricopa County alleging that Amazon\u2019s practices related to pricing and the \nFeatured Offers in its stores violate state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint also seeks injunctive relief, an \nunspecified amount of damages, civil penalties, and costs. Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part \nin Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the \nCalifornia Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies \nare inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. \nIn August 2024, the DC Court of Appeals overturned a prior decision by the DC Superior Court dismissing the DC Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s lawsuit and that case is now proceeding. In September 2024, the United States District Court for the W.D. Wash. \ngranted in part Amazon\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit brought by the FTC and certain state Attorneys General with respect to five \nstate law claims and denied the motion with respect to the remaining claims. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and \nintend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIn October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and \nAmazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among \nother things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and \n10,536,751, each entitled \u201cVideo-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV \nServices Subscribers\u201d; 10,028,026, entitled \u201cSystem for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform \nof a Digital TV Services Provider\u201d; and 9,973,825, entitled \u201cDynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based \non Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.\u201d The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of \ndamages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be \nsubject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding \nthat the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. In September 2024, the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment. This decision is subject to appeal. We dispute \nthe allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\nIn July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the \u201cCNPD\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon \nEurope Core S.\u00e0 r.l. claiming that Amazon\u2019s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection \nRegulation. The decision imposes a fine of \u20ac746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD\u2019s decision \nto be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\nIn December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the \u201cICA\u201d) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.\u00e0 \nr.l., Amazon Europe Core S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon EU S.\u00e0 r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming \nthat certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial \nactions and a fine of \u20ac1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe \nthe ICA\u2019s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.  \nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents \nrelated to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, \nthe United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International \nTrade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of \nAmazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia\u2019s patents; some of the complaints additionally allege \ninfringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and,",
  "in some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These \nmatters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary and final injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the \nallegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIn addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory \nproceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, \nprivacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, \nand other matters.\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant \nuncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular \nbasis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including \namounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our \naccruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or \nrange of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of \nlosses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if \nany of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the \n60",

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the \nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024 were $(7) million, $91 million, and $121 million.\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 \nand thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net \noperating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. \nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, \nLuxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by \nthe relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing \ntax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. \nIn September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (\u201cLTA\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we \ndistributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this \nmatter. We believe the LTA\u2019s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect \nto recoup taxes paid. \nThe Indian tax authority (\u201cITA\u201d) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will \nneed to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe \nthe ITA\u2019s position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter \nis adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax \ncontingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and \nregulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the \namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts \naccrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax \nauthorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or \nsettlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019 tax filings. The actual amount of any \nchange could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an \nestimate of the range of possible outcomes.\nNote 10 \u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all \nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated \nstatements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the \nperiod ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion \nthereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its \nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report \non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control \nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \nmaintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a \nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed \nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSeattle, Washington \nFebruary 6, 2025\n71",
