It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, \nan AI-first company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these \nbusinesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level \nactivities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and \nindependence. \nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world\u2019s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and \nsmall. Our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant \ntoday as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find \nanswers to a company that also helps people get things done. \nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools \nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information \nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year. \nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support \nthe creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today\u2019s business \nchallenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and \nbuilding new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more \nthan $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n4.",
  "Making AI Helpful for Everyone\nWe believe AI is a profound platform shift, one that can bring meaningful and positive change to people and \nsocieties across the world, and to our business. At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for \nmore than a decade and making them available to our users. \n In 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of \nGemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can \ngeneralize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code, \naudio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people \neveryday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products \u2014 Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and \nYouTube \u2014 are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at \nthe forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as \nassistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges. For example, in \n2020, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold system solved a 50-year-old protein folding challenge, and in 2024, we \nintroduced AlphaFold 3, built on the previous models, to predict the structure and interactions of all the molecules in \nlife's processes. \nWe are focused on transforming our products to provide the most helpful tools to our users and customers as we \ndeliver on our mission to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. \nDeliver the Most Advanced, Safe, and Responsible AI\nWe aim to build the most advanced, safe, and responsible AI through a full stack of robust AI-optimized \ninfrastructure, including data centers, chips, and a global fiber network; world class research teams; and a broad global \nreach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world.\nWe are driving efficiencies in our data centers, while making significant hardware and model improvements. For \nexample, since we started serving AI Overviews to our users, we have significantly lowered machine costs and latency \nthrough hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. Our AI-optimized infrastructure allows us to use, and \noffer our customers, a range of AI accelerator options, including our own custom-built Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). \nOur teams across Alphabet leverage Gemini, as well as other AI models we have previously developed and \nannounced, to deliver the best product and service experiences for our users, advertisers, partners, customers, and \ndevelopers. We are using Gemini 2.0 in new research prototypes, including Project Astra, which explores the future \ncapabilities of a universal AI assistant and Project Mariner, an early prototype capable of taking actions in Chrome as \nan experimental extension.\nWe believe our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible. That means developing AI in a way that \nmaximizes the positive benefits to society while addressing its potential challenges, guided by our AI Principles. \nEnable Organizations and Developers to Innovate on Google Cloud\nAI is a major technology shift for enterprises. Globally, businesses from startups to large enterprises, and the \npublic sector are thinking about how to drive transformation. That is why we are focused on making it easy and \nscalable for others to innovate, and grow, with AI. That means providing advanced computing infrastructure and \nexpanding access to Google\u2019s latest AI models. Our Vertex AI platform gives developers the ability to train, tune, \naugment, test, and deploy applications using Gemini, Imagen, Veo, and other generative AI models. Gemini for Google \nCloud provides pre-packaged AI agents that can assist developers to write, document, test, and operate software as \nwell as assist cybersecurity teams to analyze, detect, protect, and respond to threats.\nImprove Knowledge, Learning, Creativity, and Productivity\nAs AI continues to improve rapidly, we are focused on transforming our products to provide our users the most \nhelpful tools. Examples include AI Overviews, which allow users to ask their most complex questions, break down \nconcepts in a format that is useful for them, or take a video and ask a question out loud, and NotebookLM, which helps \nusers understand complex information by summarizing sources and providing relevant quotes. We are embedding the \npower of generative AI to continue helping our users express themselves and get things done. For example, the \nGemini app allows users to collaborate with new AI features that include image generation capabilities, coding support,",
  "and app integration. Gemini for Google Workspace helps users write, organize, visualize, accelerate workflows, and \nhave richer meetings. Additionally, we are using Gemini to improve recommendations on YouTube. We also know \nbusinesses of all sizes around the world rely on Google Ads to find customers and grow their businesses \u2014 and we \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n5.",
  "make that even easier with AI. For example, advertisers are able to use our updated image generation in Google Ads \nto produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns, and Demand Gen helps them reach their target audiences.\nBuild the Most Helpful Personal Computing Platforms and Devices\nOver the years, our Pixel phones have incorporated AI compute directly into the device and built experiences on \ntop of it. Our latest Pixel devices were built with Gemini Nano, bringing the best AI-assistive experiences to our users, \nsuch as Gemini on Pixel, Pixel Screenshots, and Pixel Studio. Our Android and Chrome operating systems enable \nusers to access Gemini, and other Google AI features throughout their day. For example, with Circle to Search built \ndirectly into the Android experience, users can search anything they see on their phone using a simple gesture.\nMoonshots\nMany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This \nincrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not \nevolutionary. Our acquisitions of YouTube and Android and subsequent launch of Chrome have matured into major \nplatforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. In Other Bets, our fully autonomous driving \ntechnology company, Waymo, is now providing fully autonomous, paid ride-hailing services to customers in multiple \ncities.\nOur early investments in AI started out as moonshots but are now incorporated into our core products and central \nto future developments. We continue to look toward the future and to invest for the long term, most notably for the \napplication of AI to our products and services, as well as other frontier technologies such as quantum computing. As \nwe said in the original founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in, as \nthey are the key to our long-term success.\nPrivacy and Security\nWe make it a priority to protect the privacy and security of our products, users, and customers, even if there are \nnear-term financial consequences. We do this by continuously investing in building products that are secure by default; \nstrictly upholding responsible data practices that emphasize privacy by design; and building easy-to-use settings that \nput people in control. We are continually enhancing these efforts over time, whether by enabling users to auto-delete \ntheir data, applying privacy technologies like on-device processing, giving people tools to control their experience, or \nadvancing anti-malware, anti-phishing, and password security features.\nGoogle\nFor reporting purposes Google comprises two segments: Google Services and Google Cloud.\nGoogle Services\nServing Our Users\nWe have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people \nworldwide. Our product innovations are what make our services widely used, and our brand one of the most \nrecognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Gmail, \nGoogle Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by \nusers around the world.\nOur products and services have come a long way since the company was founded more than 25 years ago. \nWhile Google Search started as a way to find web pages, organized into ten blue links, we have driven technical \nadvancements and product innovations that have transformed Google Search into a dynamic, multimodal experience. \nWe first expanded from traditional desktop browsers into mobile web search, making it easier to navigate on smaller \nscreens. As new types of content surfaced on the internet, Universal Search made it possible to search multiple \ncontent types, like news, images, videos, and more, to deliver rich, relevant results. The introduction of new search \nmodalities, like voice and visual search, made it easier for people to express their curiosity in natural and intuitive \nways. We took that a step further with multisearch, which lets people search with text and images at the same time. \nLarge language models have made it possible to express more natural language queries, vastly improving the types of \nquestions users can ask, and the quality of results. Each advancement has made it easier and more natural for people \nto find what they are looking for. We are now using Gemini customized for Google Search to provide our users an \nimproved Search experience, and AI Overviews has been released in more than one hundred countries, reaching more \nthan one billion users.\nThis drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery \nand creation of digital content both on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. People are \nconsuming many forms of digital content, including watching videos, streaming TV, playing games, listening to music,",
  "Table of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n6.",
  "reading books, and using apps. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people \naround the world to create and find great digital content.\nFueling all of these great digital experiences are extraordinary platforms and devices. That is why we continue to \ninvest in platforms like our Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, and Chrome operating system, as well \nas our family of devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful and make people's lives easier by \ncombining the best of our AI, software, and hardware. This potential is reflected in our latest generation of devices, \nsuch as the new Pixel 9 series and the Pixel Watch 3. Creating products and services that people rely on every day is \na journey that we are investing in for the long-term.\nHow We Make Money\nWe have built world-class advertising technologies for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital \nmarketing businesses. Our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses through our wide \nrange of products across devices and formats, and we aim to ensure positive user experiences by serving the right ads \nat the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. AI has been foundational to our \nadvertising business for more than a decade. Products like Demand Gen, Performance Max, and Product Studio use \nthe full power of our AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities.\nGoogle Services generates revenues primarily by delivering both performance and brand advertising that appears \non Google Search & other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties (\"Google Network \nproperties\"). We continue to invest in both performance and brand advertising and seek to improve the measurability of \nadvertising so advertisers understand the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\u2022\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on leading to direct \nengagement with advertisers. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving \nmeasurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads.\n\u2022\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity for advertisers' products and services, \nthrough videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand \nadvertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing \ncampaigns. \nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. \nWe focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, including filtering \nout invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our systems every year, and closely monitoring the sites, apps, and \nvideos where ads appear and blocklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do not fund bad content.\nIn addition, Google Services increasingly generates revenues from products and services beyond advertising, \nincluding:\n\u2022\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases; and\n\u2022\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices.\nGoogle Cloud\nThrough our Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace offerings, Google Cloud generates revenues \nprimarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, applications, and other cloud \nservices. Customers use Google Cloud in multiple ways such as:\n\u2022\nAI-optimized Infrastructure: provides open, reliable, and scalable compute, networking, and storage to \nenable customers to run workloads anywhere \u2014 on our Cloud, at the edge, or in their data centers. It can be \nused to migrate and modernize IT systems and to train and serve various types of AI models. \n\u2022\nDeveloper Platform: provides developers, through the Vertex AI platform, the ability to train, tune, augment, \ntest, and deploy applications using Gemini and other leading generative AI models. We offer widely used first-\nparty, third-party, and open models along with services such as vector search, grounding, and distillation to \nfurther improve the cost and quality of models.\n\u2022\nCybersecurity: provides AI powered cybersecurity solutions to help customers analyze, detect, protect, and \nrespond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats, to further strengthen security outcomes, prioritize which \nthreats to investigate, and identify attack paths, as well as accelerate resolution of cybersecurity threats.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n7.",
  "\u2022\nData and Analytics: provides a variety of different types of databases \u2014 relational, key-value, and in-memory \n\u2014 to store and manage data for different types of applications and deliver data to AI agents. Our data platform \nalso unifies data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single \nplatform that helps users analyze data using AI models across any cloud.\n\u2022\nApplications: offers a broad applications portfolio, including Gemini for Google Cloud and Gemini for Google \nWorkspace, as well as purpose-built agents for Search and our Customer Engagement Suite. AI has been \nused in Google Workspace for years to improve grammar, efficiency, security, and more with features like \nSmart Reply, Smart Compose, and malware and phishing protection in Gmail. Now, Gemini for Google \nWorkspace brings our AI-powered agents into Gmail, Docs, Sheets and more to help users write, organize, \nvisualize, accelerate workflows, and have richer meetings.\nOther Bets\n Across Alphabet, we are also using technology to try to solve big problems that affect a wide variety of industries, \nincluding transportation and health technology. Alphabet\u2019s investment in the portfolio of Other Bets includes businesses \nthat are at various stages of development, ranging from those in the R&D phase to those that are in the beginning \nstages of commercialization. Our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses. Other Bets operate as \nindependent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. \nWhile these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating \nrevenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the \nsale of healthcare-related services, and internet services.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable \ncompetition in every aspect of our business, including but not limited to, from:\n\u2022\ngeneral purpose search engines and information services;\n\u2022\nvertical search engines and e-commerce providers for queries on topics such as those related to travel, jobs, \nand health, which users may navigate directly to rather than go through Google;\n\u2022\nonline advertising platforms and networks, including online shopping and streaming services;\n\u2022\nother forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television as our advertisers \ntypically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline;\n\u2022\ndigital content and application platform providers;\n\u2022\nproviders of enterprise cloud services;\n\u2022\ndevelopers and providers of AI products and services;\n\u2022\ncompanies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that \nhave developed proprietary platforms;\n\u2022\nproviders of digital video services; \n\u2022\nsocial networks, which users may rely on for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information \nthrough traditional search engines;\n\u2022\nproviders of workspace communication and connectivity products; and \n\u2022\ndigital assistant providers.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and \ntechnologies to the marketplace across our businesses. For example, for advertising, competing successfully depends \non attracting and retaining:\n\u2022\nusers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance \nof our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n\u2022\nadvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver \ntheir advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ncontent providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners \ngenerate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n8.",

To make progress toward this effort, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), \nand Scope 3 absolute emissions (compared to our 2019 base year) by 2030, and we plan to invest in nature-based \nand technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.\nOur primary approach to reducing our Scope 2 emissions is through the procurement of carbon-free energy \n(CFE). In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 CFE every hour of every day on every grid where we operate by 2030. In \n2023, we began implementing our carbon removals strategy, and we have begun establishing impactful partnerships \nand have started contracting for carbon removal credits.\nAchieving net-zero emissions and 24/7 CFE by 2030 are extremely ambitious goals. We also know that our path \nto net-zero emissions will not be easy or linear. Some of our plans may take years to deliver results, particularly where \nthey involve building new large-scale infrastructure with long lead times. Our approach will continue to evolve and will \nrequire us to navigate significant uncertainty, including the uncertainty around the future environmental impact of AI, \nwhich is complex and difficult to predict. In addition, solutions for some key global challenges do not currently exist, \nand will depend heavily on the development and improvement of new technologies by us and by the energy sector. As \nour business and industry continue to evolve, we expect our total GHG emissions to rise before dropping toward our \nabsolute emissions reduction target.\nFor additional information about risks and uncertainties applicable to our work on sustainability and efficiency, see \nItem 1A Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCulture and Workforce\nWe are a company of curious, talented, and passionate people.

Reduced spending by advertisers, a \nloss of partners, or new and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to personalize \nads could harm our business.\nWe generated more than 75% of total revenues from online advertising in 2024. Many of our advertisers,",
  "companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their \ncontracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value \n(such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n10.",
  "monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, such as \nour initiatives related to third-party cookies, including our announcement in July 2024 to move from phasing out all \nthird-party cookies to a proposed user choice model (which remains subject to continuing discussions with regulators), \nas well as changes to other companies\u2019 advertising and/or data privacy practices have in the past, and may in the \nfuture, affect the advertising services that we are able to provide. In addition, technologies have been developed that \nmake personalized ads more difficult, or that block the display of ads altogether, and some providers of online services \nhave integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital \nadvertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to correlate with overall economic conditions. Adverse \nmacroeconomic conditions have affected, and may in the future affect, the demand for advertising, resulting in \nfluctuations in the amounts our advertisers spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and \noperating results.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that \nare useful to users, customers, and other partners, we may not remain competitive, which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing \ntechnologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, \nwe must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative, relevant and useful products, services, \nand technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a \nwider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in technical infrastructure and \nR&D, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology, products, and services. \nWe have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international \ncompetitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer \noperating histories and well-established relationships in various sectors. They can use their experience and resources \nin ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions and entering into other strategic \narrangements; continuing to invest heavily in technical infrastructure, R&D, and in talent; initiating intellectual property \nand competition claims (whether or not meritorious); and continuing to compete for users, advertisers, customers, and \ncontent providers. Further, discrepancies in enforcement of existing laws may enable our lesser known competitors to \naggressively interpret those laws without commensurate scrutiny, thereby affording them competitive advantages. Our \ncompetitors may also be able to innovate and provide products and services faster or more cost effectively than we \ncan or may foresee the need for products and services before we do. \nWe are expanding our investment in AI across the entire company. This includes generative AI and continuing to \nintegrate AI capabilities into our products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly \nevolving, and require significant investment, including technical infrastructure, development and operational costs, to \nmeet the changing needs and expectations of our existing users and attract new users. Our ability to deploy certain AI \ntechnologies critical for our products and services and for our business strategy may depend on the availability and \npricing of third-party equipment and other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, \nand equipment costs. Additionally, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or \nsuperior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and/or deploy. Other companies may also have (or in the \nfuture may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, \nor sell our own AI products and services.\nOur financial condition and operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive in a \ntimely manner to the evolving needs and desires of our users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content \nproviders, or if we miscalculate those needs and desires and invest significantly in areas that fail to gain sufficient \nmarket traction. As new and existing technologies continue to develop, competitors and new entrants may be able to",
  "offer experiences that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. These technologies \ncould reduce usage of our products and services, and force us to compete in different ways and expend significant \nresources to develop and operate equal or better products and services. Competitors\u2019 success in providing compelling \nproducts and services or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers \ncould harm our financial condition and operating results. \nOur ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and \ncould divert management attention and harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies in a \nwide range of industries beyond online advertising. The investments that we are making across our businesses, such \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n11.",
  "as building AI capabilities into new and existing products and services, reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and \nprovide products and services that are helpful to users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and content providers. Our \ninvestments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in \npursuing new strategies, we may incur unanticipated liabilities. \nWe have invested significantly and expect to continue to invest significantly in our property and equipment, \nincluding our technical infrastructure, and we expect these assets to benefit our business over their estimated useful \nlives. Changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned \nuse and utilization of assets, and/or technological advancements, could indicate a change in the period over which we \nexpect to benefit from the asset and impact our financial condition and operating results.\nInnovations in our products and services could also result in changes to user behavior and affect our revenue \ntrends. These endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of resources and management \nattention from current operations, different monetization models, and the use of alternative investment, governance, or \ncompensation structures that may fail to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their \nobjectives.\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in devices, including our smartphones, home devices, and \nwearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid \nadoption of technological advancements by competitors, increased market saturation in developed countries, short \nproduct life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in performance characteristics, and price and \nfeature sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide \ndevices that compete effectively. \nWithin Google Cloud, we devote significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, \nincluding Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, and we are advancing our AI platforms and models to \nsupport these tools and technologies. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud \ncomputing services, invest in cybersecurity, and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our sales force. At the \nsame time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing, including platform \nswitching costs, are challenging across the industry, and delivery models are competitive and constantly evolving, and \nwe may therefore not achieve our business objectives. Further, our business with financial services, healthcare, and \npublic sector customers may present additional risks, including regulatory compliance risks. For instance, we may be \nsubject to government audits and cost reviews, and any failure to comply or any deficiencies found may expose us to \nlegal, financial, and/or reputational risks. Evolving laws and regulations may require us to make new capital \ninvestments, build new products, and seek partners to deliver localized services in other countries, and we may not be \nable to meet sovereign operating requirements. \nWithin Other Bets, we are investing significantly in areas such as health, life sciences, and transportation, among \nothers. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors, and \nour offerings, many of which involve the development of new and emerging technologies, may not be successful, or be \nable to compete effectively or operate at sufficient levels of profitability. \nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI, raise ethical, technological, \nlegal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and \nservices. Because all of these investment areas are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies \nand offerings will be successful or will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we may experience downward pressure on our \noperating margin in the future. \nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including changes in the \ndevices and modalities used to access our products and services; changes in geographic mix; deceleration or declines \nin advertiser spending; competition; changes in customer usage and demand for our existing products and increasing \ndemand for new technologies; decreases in the pricing of our products and services; ongoing product and policy \nchanges; and shifts to lower priced products and services.",
  "changes; and shifts to lower priced products and services. \nIn addition, we may experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, \nsuch as an increase in the mix of lower-margin products and services, in particular from the continued expansion of our \nbusiness into new fields, including products and services such as our devices, Google Cloud, and consumer \nsubscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those \nwe generate from advertising. In particular, margins on our devices have had, and may continue to have, an adverse \neffect on our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales. We may also experience \ndownward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increasing costs \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n12.",
  "for many aspects of our business, including higher level of investment in technical infrastructure. Further, certain of our \ncosts and expenses are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. We may also \nnot be able to continue to execute our efficiency efforts successfully or in a timely manner. Due to these factors and the \nevolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be \nindicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect and \nRevenues and Monetization Metrics in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of \nour products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete. \nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for \nus. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, \nservices, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country \nin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have \ntaken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection \nfor our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have \nadequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the \npossibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or \nunenforceable. \nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and \nother sensitive information could be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting \nfrom these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word \n\u201cGoogle\u201d could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word \u201csearch.\u201d Some courts have \nruled that \"Google\" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the U.S., \nmay reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in \nother people using the word \u201cGoogle\u201d to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand. \nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. \nAlso, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of \nour intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our financial condition and operating \nresults. \nOur business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our \nability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. \nOur strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \nbrands within Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch \nnew and innovative products and services that better serve the needs of our users, advertisers, customers, content \nproviders, and other partners. Our brands have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by a number of \nfactors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and \nsecurity issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to respond \nappropriately to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services and/or products or objectionable \npractices by advertisers, or otherwise to adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our \nbrands. \nFurthermore, failure to maintain and enhance our brands could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, \nand operating results. Our success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to \nprovide high-quality, trustworthy, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a valuable role in a \nrange of settings. \nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that could harm our business, financial \ncondition, and operating results. \nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability \nto supply both our products and our services. \nWe rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture or assemble our devices as well as servers and networking",
  "equipment used in our technical infrastructure, certain components of which we may supply. We rely on third parties to \nsupply components and distribute our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not \nable to engage these companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we \nengage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes \nin the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n13.",
  "We have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, quality issues, and/\nor longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material and/or component availability, \nmanufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange \nrates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, forced labor concerns, sustainability sourcing \nrequirements, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability, and significant \nchanges in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. Some of the components we use in our technical \ninfrastructure and our devices are available from only one or limited sources, and we may not be able to find \nreplacement vendors on favorable terms in the event of a supply chain disruption. A significant supply interruption that \naffects us or our vendors could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions and delay consumer product \navailability. \nWe may enter into long-term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and \nconditions. We may face costs for materials and products that are not consumed due to market demand, technological \nchange, changed consumer preferences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because certain of \nour hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of sales \nof our devices decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing \ncosts or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and harm our \nfinancial condition and operating results. Furthermore, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable \ncontractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and \nmay affect our supply. For example, industry supply capacity for AI accelerators, including Graphics Processing Units, \nor GPUs, as well as our custom-built TPUs, is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. If we are unable to negotiate \nfavorable contractual terms or our competitors claim the supply or capacity first, we may face supply constraints.\nOur devices have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or \noperations. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or \nsuppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or our products or services are \ndefective or require a recall, it could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies \nand practices, such as the Google Supplier Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data \nsecurity, environmental compliance, and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. \nViolations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, harm to key \nrelationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property \ncould affect our ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims. \nInterruption to, interference with, or failure of our complex information technology and communications \nsystems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our \nreputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nThe availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing \noperation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, \ninterference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters \nor pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, export controls and sanctions, the effects of climate change \n(such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutdowns \nassociated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power and transmission availability challenges, \nutility outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, software bugs, cyber attacks, supply-chain attacks, \ncomputer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems. Some of our",

Our data centers are \nalso subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions \nresulting from problems experienced by facility operators or disruptions as a result of geopolitical tensions and conflicts \nhappening in the area. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for \nall eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster or pandemic, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems \naffecting our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are \nhighly technical and complex and have contained in the past, and may contain in the future, errors or vulnerabilities, \nwhich could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.

  "Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow \ninternationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues in 2024. In \naddition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent \nus from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;\n\u2022\nsanctions, import and export controls, other market access barriers, political unrest, geopolitical tensions, \nchanges in regimes, or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine), any of which \nmay affect our business continuity, increase our operating costs, limit demand for our products and services, \nlimit our ability to source components or final products, or prevent or impede us from operating in certain \njurisdictions, complying with local laws, or offering products or services;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\nan evolving foreign policy landscape that could harm our revenues and could subject us to litigation, new \nregulatory costs and challenges (including new customer requirements), uncertainty regarding regulatory \noutcomes, and other liabilities under local laws that may not offer due process or clear legal precedent;\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain \npayments to government officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties; and\n\u2022\ndifferent employee/employer relationships; different labor laws, regulations, and labor practices; and other \nchallenges caused by distance, language, local expertise, and cultural differences, increasing the complexity \nof doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nBecause we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, \nwe have faced, and will continue to face, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we \nhedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. \ndollar and foreign currencies have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our revenues and earnings. \nHedging programs are also inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial \ncondition and operating results. \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the fair values of our investments and, in some instances, our financial \nstatements incorporate inherently subjective valuation methodologies. \nThe fair value of our debt and equity investments may in the future be, and certain investments have been in the \npast, negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, performance and financial results of the underlying \nentities, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market \nin general, or other factors. \nWe measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt securities, certain other instruments including stock-\nbased compensation awards settled in the stock of Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in \na business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is inherently subjective and requires management \njudgment and estimation. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI&E, which \nincreases the volatility of our OI&E. The unrealized gains and losses or impairments we record from fair value \nremeasurements in any particular period may differ significantly from the gains and losses we ultimately realize on \nsuch investments.\nAs a result of these factors, the value of our investments could decline, which could harm our financial condition \nand operating results. \nRisks Related to our Industry \nPeople access our products and services through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to \nevolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely \nadopt versions of our products and services developed for these interfaces, our business could be harmed. \nPeople access our products and services through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, \nphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables (including virtual reality and \naugmented reality devices), automobiles, and television-streaming devices.

  "It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing \ncompetitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and \nsupporting products and services across multiple platforms and devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial \nnumber of device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to develop products and \ntechnologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating \nresults and ability to capture future business opportunities. \nIssues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm and increased liability exposure. \nOur evolving AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, inaccuracies, discrimination, \nintellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of rights of publicity, defamation, data privacy, \ncybersecurity, and other issues. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our \nimplementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability (including under \nnew and proposed legislation and regulations), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual \nproperty, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. \nSome uses of AI will present ethical issues and may have broad effects on society. In order to implement AI \nresponsibly and minimize unintended harmful effects, we have already devoted and will continue to invest significant \nresources to develop, test, and maintain our products and services, but we may not be able to identify or resolve all AI-\nrelated issues, deficiencies, and/or failures before they arise. Unintended consequences, uses, or customization of our \nAI tools and systems may negatively affect human rights, privacy, employment, or other social concerns, which may \nresult in claims, lawsuits, brand or reputational harm, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our \nbusiness, financial condition, and operating results.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could harm our \nreputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from \nusing our products and services. Computer viruses, software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks \non our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users\u2019 \nand customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, harming our business and reputation. \nConcerns about, including the adequacy of, our practices with regard to the collection, use, governance, \ndisclosure, or security of personal data or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our \nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as \nexpectations and regulations regarding privacy and data change. \nOur products and services involve the storage, handling, and transmission of proprietary and other sensitive \ninformation. Malicious software such as viruses, software bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products \nand services, as well as cyber attacks, phishing schemes, and other types of security breaches expose us to a risk of \nloss or improper use and disclosure of such information, which could result in litigation and other potential liabilities, \nincluding regulatory fines and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our products incorporate highly \ntechnical and complex technologies, and thus our technologies and software have contained, and are likely in the \nfuture to contain, undetected errors, bugs, and/or vulnerabilities. We continue to add new features involving AI to our \nofferings and internal systems, and features that rely on AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats as our \nand the market\u2019s understanding of AI-centric security risks and protection methods continue to develop. We have in the \npast discovered, and may in the future discover, some errors in our software code only after we have released the \ncode. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent \ndisclosure of user data could result in regulatory and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation, brand, and \nbusiness, and impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. Such incidents have occurred in the past and \nmay continue to occur due to the scale and nature of our products and services. While there is no guarantee that such \nincidents will not cause significant damage, we expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security \nprotections that limit the effect of bugs, theft, misuse, and security vulnerabilities or breaches.",
  "We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. \nCyber attacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods \nof time. For example, the development and implementation of AI technologies may further increase our exposure to or \nexacerbate the risks of cyber attacks or other security incidents, particularly where such technologies are exploited by \nthird parties to breach our or other parties\u2019 systems, including when such technologies are used to target our \nemployees or impersonate members of senior management in order to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We \nhave also seen, and will continue to see, industry-wide software supply chain vulnerabilities, which could affect our or \nother parties\u2019 systems. We expect to continue to experience such incidents or vulnerabilities in the future.

  "Problematic content on our platforms, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content \nfarms, and other violations of our guidelines could affect the quality of our services, which could harm our \nreputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. \nWe, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines across our platforms, including \nsophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate \nrevenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or intent. While we invest \nsignificantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and \ninvalid traffic, we have been unable and may continue to be unable to detect and prevent all such abuses or promote \nuniformly high-quality content. Increased use of AI in our offerings and internal systems may create new avenues of \nabuse for bad actors.\nMany websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in \nsearch results than our search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts have \naffected, and may continue to affect, the quality of content on our platforms and lead them to display false, misleading, \nor undesirable content. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam \nin most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their \nrankings.

The costs of compliance with these measures are high and are likely to \nincrease in the future, including as a result of differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n18.",
  "New or changing laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a \nmanner inconsistent with our interpretations of such laws and regulations and/or our practices, have resulted in, and \nmay continue to result in, less useful products and services, altered business models and operations, limited ability to \npursue certain business practices or offer certain products and services, substantial costs, and civil or criminal liability. \nExamples include laws and regulations regarding: \n\u2022\nCompetition and technology platforms\u2019 business practices: Laws and regulations focused on large \ntechnology platforms, including the Digital Markets Act in the European Union (EU); regulations and legal \nsettlements in the U.S., South Korea, and elsewhere that affect Google Play\u2019s billing policies, fees, and \nbusiness model; as well as litigation and new and expected regulations in a range of jurisdictions, including, \namong others, in the UK, Japan, and India.\n\u2022\nAI: Laws and regulations focused on the development, use, and provision of AI technologies and other digital \nproducts and services, which could result in monetary penalties or other regulatory actions. For example, the \nEU AI Act came into force on August 1, 2024, and will generally become fully applicable after a two-year \ntransitional period (although certain obligations will take effect at an earlier or later time). The EU AI Act \nintroduces various requirements for AI systems and models placed on the market or put into service in the EU, \nincluding specific transparency and other requirements for general purpose AI systems and the models on \nwhich those systems are based. In the U.S., there is increasing uncertainty as to the federal government's \napproach to AI regulation going forward, as the continued applicability of the White House's 2023 Executive \nOrder on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which lays out a \nframework for the U.S. government, among other things, to monitor private sector development of certain \nfoundation models, remains subject to regulatory development. Several states are considering enacting or \nhave already enacted regulations concerning the use of AI technologies, including those focused on consumer \nprotection, and depending on the scope of AI regulation at the federal level, some states may move to regulate \nAI model development and deployment. Further, at the federal and state level, there have been various \nproposals (and in some cases laws enacted) addressing \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and other AI-generated synthetic media. \n\u2022\nData privacy, collection, processing, and portability: Laws and regulations further restricting the collection, \nprocessing, and/or sharing of user or advertising-related data, including privacy and data protection laws; laws \naffecting the processing of children's data (as discussed further below), data breach notification laws; laws \nlimiting data transfers (including data localization laws); and laws requiring data portability (including the EU \nData Act, as discussed further below). \n\u2022\nCopyright and other intellectual property: Copyright and related laws, including the EU Directive on \nCopyright in the Digital Single Market and European Economic Area transpositions, which have introduced \nnew licensing regimes, increase liability with respect to content uploaded by users or linked to from our \nplatforms, or create property rights in news publications that could require payments to news agencies and \npublishers, which may result in other regulatory actions. \n\u2022\nContent moderation: Various laws covering content moderation and removal, and related disclosure \nobligations, such as the EU's Digital Services Act, Florida\u2019s Senate Bill 7072 and Texas\u2019 House Bill 20, and \nlaws and proposed legislation in Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom that impose penalties for failure \nto remove certain types of content or require disclosure of information about the operation of our services and \nalgorithms, which may make it harder for services like Google Search and YouTube to detect and deal with \nlow-quality, deceptive, or harmful content, or on the other hand, may impinge on the rights of free expression, \nwhich, in turn, could impact how our platforms are viewed by users. Additionally, legislators are increasingly \nfocused on regulating online child safety, including content protections for minors under eighteen years of age. \nThese regulations could result in our having to modify our products and services and incur additional costs to \noperate and monitor minors\u2019 experiences on our products and services.\n\u2022\nConsumer protection: Consumer protection laws, including the EU\u2019s New Deal for Consumers, which could \nresult in monetary penalties and create a range of new compliance obligations.\nIn addition, the applicability and scope of these and other laws and regulations, as interpreted by courts,",
  "regulators, or administrative bodies, remain uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business.

The Court is holding a separate proceeding to determine \nremedies, which could include alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, \nincluding structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes. While we plan to appeal, \nthere can be no assurance that our appeal will succeed, or that we will be able to change or decrease the severity of \nany remedies that may be ordered, and any or all of these potential remedies could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nAlso, in December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v. Google finding that Google violated \nantitrust laws relating to Google Play's business. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024 that \nordered a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and \nGoogle Play. We are appealing the verdict, but if we are unsuccessful, we could face significant expenses to \nimplement the remedies, and such costs and alterations could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and \noperating results.\nFurthermore, in December 2020, several State Attorneys General, led by the Texas Attorney General, filed an \nantitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated antitrust and \nother laws relating to its advertising technology. This case is set for trial in March 2025, and we could face significant \ncivil penalties. In January 2023, the DOJ and several Attorneys General sued in the Eastern District of Virginia alleging \nsimilar antitrust violations relating to Google\u2019s advertising technology. Trial in the DOJ matter concluded in September \n2024 with a decision expected in early 2025. If we are unsuccessful, we could face an order on remedies that could \nharm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. \nIn addition to these regulatory proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims \npursued by regulators are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. Adverse results in these or similar \nfuture lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages and remedies that could harm our business, reputation, \nfinancial condition, and operating results.\nOther regulatory agencies in the U.S. and around the world, including competition enforcers, consumer protection \nagencies, and data protection authorities, have challenged and may continue to challenge our business practices and",

  "Further, we are subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances \nwe can transfer, process and/or receive personal data, as well as ongoing enforcement actions from supervisory \nauthorities related to cross-border transfers of personal data. The validity of various data transfer mechanisms we \ncurrently rely upon remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments globally, which may require us to \nadapt our existing arrangements.\nWe face, and may continue to face, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, violation of \nrights of publicity, and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage awards or \nother costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies. \nWe, like other internet, technology, and media companies, are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations \nof infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, including patent, copyright, trade secrets, and \ntrademarks. Parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts \nand the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. In addition, patent-\nholding companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims \nagainst us. As we continue to expand our business, the number of intellectual property claims against us has increased \nand may continue to increase as we develop and acquire new products, services, and technologies, including AI \ntechnologies. \nAdverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing \nagreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders limiting our ability to sell our products and services in the U.S. or \nelsewhere, including by preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services in certain \njurisdictions. They may also cause us to change our business practices in ways that could result in a loss of revenues \nfor us and otherwise harm our business. \nMany of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend \nagainst certain intellectual property infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual \nproperty infringement claims against them, which could result in increased costs for defending such claims or \nsignificant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also \ndiscontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could \nresult in loss of revenues and harm our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our \nsuppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from \nintellectual property infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in \nthe future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual \nproperty claims. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to \nlitigate or settle. To the extent such claims are successful, they could harm our business, including our product and \nservice offerings, financial condition, and operating results. \nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or \nexposure to additional tax liabilities. \nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. \nOur effective tax rates are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with \ndifferent statutory tax rates, net gains and losses on hedges and related transactions under our foreign exchange risk \nmanagement program, changes in our stock price for shares issued as employee compensation, changes in the \nvaluation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the application of different provisions of tax laws or changes in tax \nlaws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws). Further, if we are \nunable or fail to collect taxes on behalf of customers, employees and partners as the withholding agent, we could \nbecome liable for taxes that are levied against third parties. \nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have \nreceived, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, on various tax-related assertions, such \nas transfer-pricing adjustments or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit",
  "could harm our financial condition and operating results, require adverse changes to our business practices, or subject \nus to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income \ntaxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and often involves uncertainty. Although we believe our \nestimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements \nand may affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. \nFurthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions \nmay be subject to significant changes in ways that could harm our financial condition and operating results. For \nexample, various jurisdictions around the world have enacted or are considering revenue-based taxes such as digital \nservices taxes and other targeted taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n22.",
  "regimes. The U.S. has imposed a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of shares repurchased, which could \npotentially increase in the future. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is \ncoordinating negotiations among more than 140 countries with the goal of achieving consensus around substantial \nchanges to international tax policies, including the implementation of a minimum global effective tax rate of 15%, on \nwhich various jurisdictions around the world have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation. Our \neffective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase as a result of these changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Stock \nWe cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program or dividend program will be continuously active \nor fully consummated or will enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases or dividends could \nincrease the volatility of our stock prices and could diminish our cash reserves.\nWe engage in share repurchases of our Class A and Class C stock from time to time in accordance with \nauthorizations from the Board of Directors of Alphabet. Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and \ndoes not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. In \nApril 2024, we announced the approval of our cash dividend program and began paying regular cash dividends to our \nClass A, Class B, and Class C stockholders. Any and all future cash dividends are subject to declaration by our Board \nof Directors in its sole discretion, and in accordance with the requirements of any applicable laws, rules, and \nregulations, including the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our cash dividend program does not require, and our \nBoard of Directors may decide not to declare, a cash dividend each quarter, and does not obligate our Board of \nDirectors to declare a dividend at any specific dollar amount per share. Any such decision by our Board of Directors \nmay depend on a variety of factors that it may deem relevant, including but not limited to our earnings, liquidity, \nfinancial condition, other capital deployment opportunities, level of indebtedness, and general market conditions. Our \nshare repurchases or dividends could affect our share trading prices, increase their volatility, reduce our cash reserves \nand may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading prices of our stock. \nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. \nOur Class B stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A stock has one vote per share, and our Class C stock has \nno voting rights. As of December 31, 2024, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 87.4% of our \noutstanding Class B stock, which represented approximately 52.1% of the voting power of our outstanding common \nstock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring \nstockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or \nother sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C stock carries no \nvoting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C stock, including in future stock-based \nacquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey\u2019s current \nrelative voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters \nsubmitted to a vote of our stockholders. The share repurchases made pursuant to our repurchase program may also \naffect Larry and Sergey\u2019s relative voting power. This concentrated control limits or severely restricts other stockholders\u2019 \nability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as beneficial, \nwhich could reduce the market price of our Class A stock and our Class C stock. \nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that \nstockholders may consider favorable. \nProvisions in Alphabet\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a \nchange of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following: \n\u2022\nOur Board of Directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of \nDirectors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director.\n\u2022\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent, which makes it difficult to take certain actions without holding \na stockholders' meeting.\n\u2022\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of \nminority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022",
  "minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n\u2022\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to \npropose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter \na potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or \notherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n23.",
  "\u2022\nOur Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock, \nwhich makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or \npreferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us. \nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware \nlaw, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting \nstock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved \nthe transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. \nThe trading price for our Class A stock and non-voting Class C stock may continue to be volatile. \nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced significant volatility and may continue to be volatile. In \naddition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading prices of our Class A stock and Class C stock have \nfluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate widely, in response to various factors, including, among others, the size or \ncontinuity of either our share repurchase or dividend programs, the activities of our peers and changes in broader \neconomic and political conditions around the world. These broad market and industry factors could harm the market \nprice of our Class A stock and our Class C stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nGeneral Risks \nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our \nresults to fall short of expectations. \nOur operating results have fluctuated, and may in the future fluctuate, as a result of a number of factors, many \noutside of our control, including the cyclical nature and seasonality in our business and geopolitical events. As a result, \ncomparing our operating results (including our expenses as a percentage of our revenues) on a period-to-period basis \nmay not be meaningful, and our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. \nConsequently, our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, \nand other consequences that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. \nAcquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy \nand use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect \nto continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of such potential strategic arrangements, \nwhich could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas where we face risks include: \n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and \nother strategic arrangements; \n\u2022\nfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities; conditions placed \nupon approval that could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise \nrestrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction; or investigations or \nlitigation by governmental authorities related to our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the acquired operations, technologies, services, and personnel (including \ncultural integration and retention of employees) and further develop the acquired business or technology; \n\u2022\nimplementation of controls (or remediation of control deficiencies), procedures, and policies at the acquired \ncompany; \n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting and other administrative systems, and the coordination of \nproduct, engineering, and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\ntransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages \nand to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific \ncountries; \n\u2022\nfailure to accomplish commercial, strategic or financial objectives with respect to investments, joint ventures, \nand other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the value of investments and joint ventures due to a lack of liquidity;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark \ninfringement claims, data privacy and security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, \nwarranty claims, product liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n24.",
  "\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated \nemployees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions \nand other strategic arrangements could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated \nliabilities, and harm our business generally. \nOur acquisitions and other strategic arrangements could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, \nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased \nlong-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition and operating results. \nAlso, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic arrangements may not materialize. In \nconnection with our divestitures and certain other strategic arrangements, we have agreed, and may in the future \nagree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and operating \nresults. \nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire \nqualified personnel, or maintain and continue to adapt our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow or \noperate effectively. \nOur performance and future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key technical leads as \nwell as members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar Pichai is critical to the overall management of \nAlphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology, maintaining our \nculture, and setting our strategic direction. \nOur ability to compete effectively and our future success depend on our continuing to identify, hire, develop, \nmotivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified \nemployees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted, and may continue to target, our \nemployees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be \nsuccessful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Immigration policy and \nregulatory changes may also affect our ability to hire, mobilize, or retain some of our global talent. All of our executive \nofficers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization \ngrows and evolves, we may need to adapt our corporate culture and work environments to ever-changing \ncircumstances, such as during times of a natural disaster or pandemic, and these changes could affect our ability to \ncompete effectively or have an adverse effect on our corporate culture. Under our hybrid work models, we may \nexperience increased costs and/or disruption, in addition to potential effects on our ability to operate effectively and \nmaintain our corporate culture. \nITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C.

We obtain input, as appropriate, for our cybersecurity risk \nmanagement program on the security industry and threat trends from multiple external experts and internal threat \nintelligence teams. Teams of dedicated privacy, safety, and security professionals oversee cybersecurity risk \nmanagement and mitigation, incident prevention, detection, and remediation. These teams comprise professionals with \ndeep cybersecurity expertise across multiple industries and are led by our Vice President of Privacy, Safety, and \nSecurity Engineering, who has 20 years of experience, including roles in technology infrastructure for two other large \npublic companies.

Discussion of 2023 results \ncompared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on \nForm 10-K.\nUnderstanding Alphabet\u2019s Financial Results\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses \u2014 the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, \nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further \ndetails on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate \nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022\nUsers' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since \ninception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \npace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and \nadvertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, \nsuch as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no \nmatter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front \nof these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market \nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, \nwe continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our \nproducts and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, \nthat could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user \nexperience and then on monetization.\n\u2022\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \nrates affect such revenues. \nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n30.",
  "revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these \nmarkets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as \ndeveloping markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nInternational revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign \ncurrency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program \ndesigned to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues \nand earnings.\n\u2022\nThe revenues that we derive beyond advertising are increasing and may adversely affect our margins.\nRevenues from cloud, consumer subscriptions, platforms, and devices, which may have differing characteristics \nthan our advertising revenues, have grown over time, and we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding \nour products and services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins \non our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to \npressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\n\u2022\nAs we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and \ncapital expenditures.\nWe continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to \ndevelop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our \nbusinesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including \nservers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in \nparticular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important \nelements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in \nengineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\n\u2022\nWe continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, \ninvestigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and \nfinancial results.\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide \nrange of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in \nfines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may \nincrease, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer \ncertain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to \ncomply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

Cost-\nper-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average \namount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in \nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based \nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for \neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, \nand counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues generated by \nthe corresponding click and impression activity.\nFluctuations in our advertising revenues, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google Search \n& other properties and the change in impressions and cost-per-impression on Google Network properties and the \ncorrelation between these items have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general \nfactors described above, such as:\n\u2022\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n\u2022\nchanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\n\u2022\nchanges in device mix;\n\u2022\nseasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and underlying business trends, such as \ntraditional retail seasonality; and\n\u2022\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various verticals and \nchannels.\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues are comprised of the following:\n\u2022\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n\u2022\nother products and services.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n32.",

These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI \ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google \nWorkspace; and\n\u2022\nother enterprise services.\nFluctuations in our Google Cloud revenues have been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to \nthe general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services, and internet \nservices.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses \ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and \nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our \noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, \nfluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors \nsuch as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022\nTAC includes: \n\u25e6\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n\u25e6\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022\nOther cost of revenues primarily includes:\n\u25e6\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n\u25e6\nemployee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as \ncontent review and customer and product support;\n\u25e6\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n\u25e6\nother technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment \ncosts.\nTAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly \nhigher than TAC as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Search & other properties, \nbecause most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our \nGoogle Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n33.",

The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and \nare not readily determinable.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make \nestimates and assumptions. Our critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of \nuncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a \nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from \nour estimates. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable \nunder the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We have reviewed our critical \naccounting estimates with the Audit and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nFor a summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements, see Note 1 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFair Value Measurements of Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, consisting primarily of our non-\nmarketable equity securities. These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the \nmeasurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments \nresulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments \nrequire quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. \nAdjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of \nestimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nNon-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the \ncompanies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of \nimpairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market \napproach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount \nrates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others. \nWhen the quantitative remeasurements of fair value indicate an impairment exists, we write down the investment to its \ncurrent fair value.\nWe also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments, i.e. \nperformance fees. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe assess the reasonableness of the useful lives of our property and equipment periodically as well as when \nother changes occur, such as when there are changes to ongoing business operations, changes in the planned use \nand utilization of assets, or technological advancements, that could indicate a change in the period over which we \nexpect to benefit from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating \nour uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nRecording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of \ncomparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain \ntax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial \nopinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately \nreserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not",
  "be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n44.",
  "differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination \nis made.\nThe provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the \nrelated net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns \nby the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of \nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for \nincome taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, \nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, \nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by \nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these \nmatters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we \nbelieve that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine \nthat a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note \n10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nWe evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that \nhas been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make \nadjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the \nestimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an \nexposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\nITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, \nand equity investment risks. \nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. International revenues, as well as costs and expenses \ndenominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the \nU.S. dollar. As discussed below, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency risk. Principal \ncurrencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the \npurpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange \nrates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be \nexperienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and \nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. These forward and option \ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets \nand liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on these assets and liabilities are recorded in OI&E, which are \noffset by the gains and losses on the forward and option contracts.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to net monetary assets, liabilities, and \ncommitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies at the balance sheet date, it would have \nresulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $503 million and $135 million as of \nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, after consideration of the effect of foreign exchange contracts in place for \nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) to protect forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in \nforeign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency forward and option \ncontacts reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar weakens, losses from foreign \ncurrency forward and option contracts offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging \ncontracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate \nthese contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. We reflect the gains and losses of foreign currency spot",
  "rate changes as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassify them \ninto revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur. \nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to \nour cash flow hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion lower as of \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n45.",
  "December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a \ncorresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency \nrisks related to investment in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency \ntranslation risk from our foreign operations.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI \nrelated to our net investment hedges before tax effect would have been approximately $946 million and $660 million \nlower as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The change in value recorded in CTA would be expected to \noffset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and \nmaintain liquidity. We invest primarily in debt securities, including government bonds, corporate debt securities, \nmortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, money market and other funds, time deposits, and interest rate \nderivatives. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and \nfloating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair \nmarket value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income \nthan predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains and losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily due to \ninterest rate fluctuations as compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. For certain fixed and variable rate debt \nsecurities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We measure \nsecurities for which we have not elected the fair value option at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until \nthe securities are sold, less any expected credit losses. \nWe use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value \nof our investment portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our \ninvestment portfolio due to adverse movements in interest rates.

VaR analysis is not intended to \nrepresent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.\nEquity Investment Risk\nOur marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that \ncould substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings.\nOur marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are \ninvestments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.\nWe record marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily \ndeterminable market values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and \nrepresent $6.0 billion and $5.1 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. A \nhypothetical adverse price change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of \nmarketable equity securities by $508 million. From time to time, we may enter into derivatives to hedge the market \nprice risk on certain of our marketable equity securities.\nOur non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily adjusted to fair \nvalue for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as \nthe measurement alternative). The fair value measured at the time of the observable transaction is not necessarily an \nindication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are in the \nearly stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development are \ntypically in the early phases and may never materialize, and they may experience a decline in financial condition,",
  "which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in these companies. Valuations of our equity \ninvestments in private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data and \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n46.",
  "observable transactions at lower valuations could result in significant losses. In addition, global economic conditions \ncould result in additional volatility. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on \nthe likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of investments through liquidity events such as public \nofferings, acquisitions, private sales or other market events. Changes in the valuation of non-marketable equity \nsecurities may not directly correlate with changes in valuation of marketable equity securities. As of December 31, \n2023 and 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the \nmeasurement alternative, was $28.8 billion and $35.5 billion, respectively. \nThe carrying values of our equity method investments, which totaled approximately $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion as \nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, \nthese investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover.\nFor additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n47.",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became \nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and \nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial \ninstruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We \nbase our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the \nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other \nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n\u2022\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n\u2022\nYouTube properties; and\n\u2022\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n57.",
  "\u2022\nconsumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, \nYouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\n\u2022\nplatforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\n\u2022\ndevices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\n\u2022\nother products and services.\nSubscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report \nrevenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is \nto facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee. \nGoogle Cloud Revenues\nGoogle Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\n\u2022\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, \nplatform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI \ninfrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n\u2022\nGoogle Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for \nenterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google \nWorkspace; and\n\u2022\nother enterprise services.\nOur cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract \nterms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when \nthe customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services \nprovided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and \nconsumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate \nrevenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine \nstandalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nCustomer Incentives and Credits\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. \nWe estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We \nbelieve that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer \nincentives and credits.\nSales Commissions\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We \nrecognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. \nThese costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\u2022\nTAC includes:\n\u25e6\namounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. \nOur distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, \nand software developers; and\n\u25e6\namounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n\u2022\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6\ncontent acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and \nother content for distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content providers \nbased on revenues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n\u25e6\ndepreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n58.",
  "\u25e6\nemployee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as \ncontent review and customer and product support;\n\u25e6\ninventory and other costs related to the devices we sell; and\n\u25e6\nother technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment \ncosts.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software \ncomponent of products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. \nTechnological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs \nthat meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and \ncloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software \napplications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \nsoftware will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications \nwere not material for the periods presented.\nStock-based Compensation\nStock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity \nclassified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense \nusing the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. \nRSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, \nand settled in Class C shares.\nFor RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be \npaid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and \nthe income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nAdditionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include \nmarket conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and \ncertain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite \nservice period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value \nthrough settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the \nrespective Other Bet company.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended \nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 \nbillion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain \ninvestments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may \nresult in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use \nof unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nFair Value Measurements \nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a \nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured \nand classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in \nthe market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active \nmarkets.\nLevel 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all \nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n59.",
  "these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based \nobservable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate \nvaluation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models.\nOur financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, \nmarketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets \nmeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and \nliabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nWe measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also \nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative \nfinancial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.\nCredit Risks\nWe are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial \ninstruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit \nrisk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral \nmanagement. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. \nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the \nworld. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we \nlimit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nCash Equivalents\nWe invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, \ngovernment bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.\nMarketable Securities\nWe classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of \npurchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities \non our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable \ndebt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have \nclassified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus \nreward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective \nmaturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities \nwith maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated \nBalance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a \ncomponent of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded \nin OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value \nare recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a \nspecific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nOur investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, \nincluding unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up \nrestrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-Marketable Securities\nNon-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities \nthrough which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. \nOther non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. \nUnder the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus \nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the \nsame issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are \nrecorded as a component of OI&E.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n60.",
  "Non-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nSee Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments. \nAccounts Receivable\nOur payment terms for accounts receivable vary by the types and locations of our customers and the products or \nservices offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or \nservices and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. \nAdditionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the \ncustomer.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts \nreceivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements \nof Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics \nexist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In \ndetermining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status \nand make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider \ncustomer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic \nconditions.\nConvertible Notes\nOur investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal \nbalances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are \nincluded within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nOur financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into \ncommercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the \nsubstance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be \naccounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of \nthe arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies \nbecomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing \nany remaining performance obligations.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. \nFor debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is \nestimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past \nevents, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, \nnot to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If \nwe have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized \nloss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the \ncorresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nFor non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment \nindicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among \nother indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair \nvalue by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the \nfair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nInventory\nInventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is \ncomputed using the first-in, first-out method.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in \nwhich we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n61.",
  "the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have the power to direct activities that most \nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses \nor benefits. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests in a \nVIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\nPeriodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination \nof whether the entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is comprised of technical infrastructure, office space, corporate and other assets \ncurrently in service, and assets not yet in service. Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and \nleasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and \nleasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data \ncenter buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly. \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets \nare ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the \nassets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and \nutilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers \nand network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of \ntwo to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated \nuseful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated. \nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We \nevaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in \nreporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for \nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be \nimpaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-\nlease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily \ninclude payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease \npayments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets \nand liabilities.\nCertain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the \nlease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and \npayments for maintenance and utilities.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease \ncommencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our \nincremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental \nborrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, \nand in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to \nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the \nbase, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any \nprepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nLease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our \noperating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is \nincluded in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease \nliabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\nOperating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life \nof the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when",
  "events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n62.",
  "at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by \ncomparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected \nto generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is \nmeasured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes \npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of \nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax \nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our \ndeferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets \nwhen it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax \nassets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the \nglobal intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on \ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the \nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be \nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to \nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the \npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, \nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The \nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. \nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange \nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, \ncosts, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. We \nreflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to \nfunctional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update \n(ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure \nrequirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate \nreconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes \npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either \nprospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the \neffect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-\nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity\u2019s expenses.

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services \nthat have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as \nrevenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and \ntiming of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with \nrelevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue \ncurrently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original \nexpected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including \namounts which are refundable.

  "Fair Value Measurements\nInvestments Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable equity securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 \nand Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs \nthat are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.\nDebt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use \nquoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable \ninputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which \nchanges in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the \nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities measured at fair value on \na recurring basis (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFair Value \nHierarchy\nAdjusted \nCost\nGross \nUnrealized \nGains\nGross \nUnrealized \nLosses\nFair Value\nCash and \nCash \nEquivalents\nMarketable \nSecurities\nFair value changes \nrecorded in other \ncomprehensive income\nTime deposits\nLevel 2\n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n0 \n$ \n2,628 \n$ \n2,628 $ \n0 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n38,106\n \n233 \n \n(679)  \n37,660 \n \n1,993  \n35,667 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n22,457\n \n112 \n \n(637)  \n21,932 \n \n0  \n21,932 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n17,243\n \n88 \n \n(634)  \n16,697 \n \n0  \n16,697 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nreflected in other \ncomprehensive \nincome(1)\n \n80,434 \n \n433 \n \n(1,950)  \n78,917 \n \n4,621  \n74,296 \nFair value adjustments \nrecorded in net income\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n \n6,480 \n \n6,480  \n0 \nCurrent marketable \nequity securities(2)\nLevel 1\n \n4,282 \n \n0  \n4,282 \nMutual funds\nLevel 2\n \n311 \n \n0  \n311 \nGovernment bonds\nLevel 2\n \n1,952 \n \n347  \n1,605 \nCorporate debt securities\nLevel 2\n \n3,782 \n \n91  \n3,691 \nMortgage-backed and \nasset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n \n2,683 \n \n0  \n2,683 \nTotal investments with \nfair value change \nrecorded in net \nincome\n \n19,490 \n \n6,918  \n12,572 \nCash\n \n0 \n \n12,509  \n0 \nTotal\n$ \n80,434 \n$ \n433 \n$ \n(1,950) $ \n98,407 \n$ \n24,048 $ \n86,868 \n(1)\nRepresents gross unrealized gains and losses for debt securities recorded to AOCI.\n(2)\nThe long-term portion of marketable equity securities (subject to long-term lock-up restrictions) of $1.4 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2023 is included within other non-current assets.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n65.",

The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable \ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities \nthat have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 \nin the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are \nclassified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, and \ncommon stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the \ntransaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the rights \nand obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $35.5 billion, of which \n$19.9 billion were remeasured at fair value during the year ended December 31, 2024, and were primarily classified \nwithin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\nDebt Securities\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt \nsecurities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n66.",

  "Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary risk \nmanaged is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, \nand investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We \nalso enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives \nprimarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a \ncombination of purchased and written options) at net fair values and present all other derivatives at gross fair values. \nThe accounting treatment for derivatives is based on the intended use and hedge designation.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge \ncertain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have \nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude forward points and \ntime value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize them on a straight-line basis over the life of the \nhedging instrument in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the \namount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect \nwas $731 million, which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our \nmarketable securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the \nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OI&E, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related \nhedged items. We exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the \nexcluded component in OI&E.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks \nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge \neffectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude forward \npoints from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in OI&E.\nOther Derivatives\nWe enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to \nhedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the \nfunctional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these derivatives that are not designated as accounting \nhedges are primarily recorded in OI&E along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and \nliabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, \ncommodity prices, and credit exposures, and to enhance investment returns. From time to time, we enter into \nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains and losses arising from \nother derivatives are primarily reflected within the \u201cother\u201d component of OI&E. See Note 7 for further details. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n69.",

We have agreed \nto defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or \nout of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit \nthe time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered \ninto indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification \nobligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification \nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the \npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future \npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows \nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably \npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be \nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be \nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect \nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses \ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial \nchanges to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine \nboth the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be \nunable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal matters are \ninherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a \nmaterial adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Matters\nWe are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations as well as litigation on various competition \nmatters by regulatory authorities and private parties in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally, including the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\nShopping: In June 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google relating to its \ndisplay and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European antitrust laws and imposed a \u20ac2.4 \nbillion fine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n78.",
  "compliance with the EC's decision. In September 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and \nupheld the \u20ac2.4 billion fine. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine. \n\u2022\nAndroid: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related \ndistribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion fine, and directed the \ntermination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our \nAndroid distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the \nfine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC \ndecision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of \n$5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\n\u2022\nAdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's \nagreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5 billion, \nand directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the \ndecision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In \nSeptember 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the \u20ac1.5 billion fine. The EC has \nappealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\n\u2022\nSearch: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and \nSearch advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google \nviolated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of \nwhich vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our \nproducts and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our \ndistribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our \nbusiness. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect \na decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nFurther, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the \nJapanese Fair Trade Commission each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022\nAdvertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state \ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for March 2025. Additionally, \nin January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its \nadvertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. \nThe trial ended in September 2024, and we expect a decision in early 2025. \nFurther, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that \nGoogle violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. \nGiven the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\n\u2022\nGoogle Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of California alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. \nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement \nin principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the \nsettlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow \nagent. \nIn December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in Epic Games v.

  "\u2022\nEuropean Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's \ncompliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. Given the \npreliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nIn addition to these proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by \nregulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions. \nWe believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We \ncontinue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPrivacy Matters\nWe are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of \nprivacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and \nlitigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged \nviolations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in \nsignificant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that \ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these \nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders \npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change \nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for \nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly \nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can \nresult in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a \nprohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important \nproducts into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Further, our \ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions \nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, \nand consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, \nlabor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by \nadvertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, \nwe periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent \norders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and \npenalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, \nalterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, \nall of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that \ninclude compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, \nincluding those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse \neffect.\nNon-Income Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The \nsubject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the \nsale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue \nnon-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when \na loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of \nloss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of \nthese matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our \nexpectations.\nSee Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n80.",
  "Note 11.        Stockholders' Equity \nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C \ncapital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect \nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock \nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. \nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically \nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we continued to repurchase both Class A and Class C \nshares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic \ncost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C \nshares. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, we repurchased $59.3 billion, $62.2 billion, and \n$62.0 billion, respectively, of Alphabet's Class A and Class C shares.\nIn April 2024, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 \nbillion of its Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2024, $44.7 billion remained available for Class A and \nClass C share repurchases. \nThe following table presents Class A and Class C shares repurchased and subsequently retired (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nClass A share repurchases\n78\n$ \n9,316 \n73\n$ \n11,855 \nClass C share repurchases\n450\n \n52,868 \n306\n \n50,192 \nTotal share repurchases(1)\n528\n$ \n62,184 \n379\n$ \n62,047 \n(1)         Shares repurchased include unsettled repurchases.\nRepurchases are executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other \ninvestment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule \n10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total cash dividends, which were first paid in June 2024, were $3.5 \nbillion, $519 million, and $3.3 billion for Class A, Class B, and Class C shares, respectively.\nThe company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future, subject to review and approval by the \ncompany\u2019s Board of Directors in its sole discretion.\nNote 12.        Net Income Per Share \nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net \nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive \nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of RSUs and other contingently issuable \nshares. The dilutive effect of outstanding RSUs and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings \nper share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A \nstock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B stock does not \nassume the conversion of those shares.\nIn accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the \nholders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are \na number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of \nDirectors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. \nSpecifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of \nadversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock \nadversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any \nsuch amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of \nDirectors. \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n81.",

Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is \nnot certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, \nstate, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months. \nNote 15.        Information about Segments and Geographic Areas \nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\u2022\nGoogle Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, \nGoogle Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees \nreceived for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and \nNFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and devices.\n\u2022\nGoogle Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, applications, and other services for enterprise \ncustomers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions \nreceived for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and \nother enterprise services.\n\u2022\nOther Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from \nOther Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering \nactivities, and devices, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the \nintegrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are \nmanaged centrally at a consolidated level. These costs, including the associated depreciation, are allocated to \noperating segments as a service cost generally based on usage, headcount, or revenue.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n87.",
  "As announced in April 2024, we consolidated teams that focus on building general AI models across Google \nResearch and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. General AI model development teams \npreviously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level activities \nprospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team \nthat is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated \nwith the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment.\nCertain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs \nprimarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; \ncorporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human \nresource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and \noffice space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains \n(losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nOur Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai.
