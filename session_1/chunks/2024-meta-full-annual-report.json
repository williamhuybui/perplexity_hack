  "CFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect first quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8 billion. This reflects 8-15% year-over-year \ngrowth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 3% \nheadwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also reflects the effect of lapping leap \nday in the first quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025 revenue outlook, we expect the investments we \nare making in our core business this year will give us an opportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout \n2025.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of expense \ngrowth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation(1). We expect employee \ncompensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of infrastructure, monetization, \nReality Labs, generative artificial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital expenditures \ngrowth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI efforts and core business. The \nmajority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and \nthe U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\n____________________________________\n(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in \ntheir estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of \nDecember 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately \n$2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.\n2",

  "Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-\nlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the \nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our \nability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals \nand mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-\nparty policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as \nwell as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on \ncommunity growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our \nbrand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; \ncompetition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell \nadvertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or \ndevelopments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-\ndispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential \nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the \ncaption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 31, 2024, which is available on \nour Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will \nalso be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the \ndate of this press release is January 29, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions \nthat we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new \ninformation or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations \nof Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: \nrevenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The \npresentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, \nfinancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material \nlimitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be \ndifferent from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. \nWe compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these \nnon-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial \nperformance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary \nindependent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in \noperating our business. \nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: \nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2024 \nusing the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we \nbelieve is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and \nequipment, and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two \nitems collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of \nwhether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful",
  "supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended \nto represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. \nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please \nsee the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n4",
