These\nforward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ. A detailed discussion of these and other\nrisks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included throughout this filing\nand particularly in Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements included in this document are\nbased on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or publicly release any revision to any such forward-looking\nstatement, except as may otherwise be required by law.\n\u00a0\nItem 1.\nBusiness\nABOUT US\nNetflix, Inc. (\u201cNetflix\u201d, \u201cthe Company\u201d, \u201cregistrant\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cus\u201d) is one of the world\u2019s leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million\npaid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and\nresume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members'\nexperience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported\nsubscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are\ncontinuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our\nmembers. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nCOMPETITION\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers\u2019 leisure\ntime, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content),\nvideo gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of\nentertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and\ncontent producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members,",
  "we seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\nSEASONALITY\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to\nincrease their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be\nimpacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.\n1",
  "Table of Contents\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual\nproperty as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our\nproprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through\nour service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content,\nmerchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers\nand other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of\nmusic contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our\nintellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\nREGULATION\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many\ncountries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some\ncountries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even\nrestrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that\ncould require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and\nmay make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these,\napproximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and\n1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose\nnumbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our\ncompany culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our\nemployees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of\nperspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our\nbusiness. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better experience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences\nacross and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity,\ninclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each\nNetflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it\u2019s important that our employee base is\ndiverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more\ninclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing\nemployees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion\ninitiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we",
  "believe is important for success at Netflix. We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, VPs, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and\nour teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between\ncash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee's individual needs and preferences. We\nconduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid\nbased on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to\nrectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health\nbenefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a\nway that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match\nfor charitable donations.\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\n2",

  "Table of Contents\nItem 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of\nour common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability\nto continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling\ncontent choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality\nexperience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we\nprovide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in\nnewer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may\nadversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming\nentertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by\nprofessional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free\ntime.\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household\nexpenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved.\nMembership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content\nrelease schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not\ngrow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per\nmembership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining\nour existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by\nthem, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service\nofferings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly,\nour revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live\nprogramming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not\ndone in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend\nour business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences.\nTo the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits\nor generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-\npriced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household\nusage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact",
  "our ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-\nmouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to\nattract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have\nincreasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional\nproviders of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers\nand platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content,\nlarge content libraries, and significant\n4",
  "Table of Contents\nfinancial, marketing and other resources. They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and\ndevote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing\nproviders may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments,\nincluding the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies\nmore effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental\nproposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition,\npiracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably\ncompete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain\nmarket share, revenues or profitability.\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our\nservice.\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the\nnature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our\nservice, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original\nprogramming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise\nattract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our\nbusiness, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other\nexpenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or\nrenewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with\nour productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face\npotential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law,\nbecome insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license\nsuch rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to\nremove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe\nsuch content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed\nfrom our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims\ncould be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be\nindemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related\nto our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and\nexperiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting",
  "our business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as\ndiffering legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live\nprogramming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production,\nincluding games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of\ndisciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management\nattention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may\nface integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or\ncompanies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our\ncorporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely\naffected.\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may\nface regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as\nlow quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the\nextent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect\n5",
  "Table of Contents\nretaliatory action or behavior, including being required to remove such content from our service, our entire service could be banned and/or become subject to\nheightened regulatory scrutiny across our business and operations. We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the\nextent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our\nability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members\nand other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new\ndisclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent we are unable to meet regulatory or industry standards or investor expectations on ESG issues or the\ncontent we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or\ninvestments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to\nlitigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, among other acquisition-related\nrisks.\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not\ncomplete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the\nacquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could\narise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with\nacquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players,\nTV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available\nthrough the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content\nproviders. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers\nservices or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to\nwatch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with\nexisting partners and to increase our capability to stream content and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in\nmaintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering\nour streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a\nnumber of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree\nof accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be\nresponsible for the devices\u2019 performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us\nand such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming\nfunctionality may require that partners update their devices, and from time to time, lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy\ndevices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and\nenjoyment could be negatively impacted.",
  "enjoyment could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit,\nonline wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of\nthese payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication\nrequirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees,\nmaterial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to\nrules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems,\npartner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill members on our behalf. If these third\nparties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition members or otherwise find alternative methods\nof collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of\npayment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of\nour service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may\n6",
  "Table of Contents\nimpose fines, our card approval rate may be impacted and we may be subject to additional card authentication requirements. The termination of our ability to\nprocess payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our\nbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the\nmanner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly\nlooking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law\nenables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators that provide services in their jurisdiction. Several\nEuropean Union (EU) Member States have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and\ndevelopment of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. Rules\ngoverning new technological developments, including generative artificial intelligence, are nascent and rapidly evolving such that the impact on areas related to\nour business remains uncertain. For example, in Europe, the Digital Markets Act remains subject to non-compliance investigations, the result of which could\nchange how we interact with digital gatekeepers like Apple and Google. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations\nof existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, requiring\npayment of network access fees or payment of network support taxes, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business.\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many\ncountries, including across the EU and several U.S. states. In others, the laws may be nascent, evolving or non-existent. For example, a U.S. federal appeals\ncourt recently overturned the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing\ninterpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience\ndiscriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's\ntime and attention.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we\nhave seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, products, patent\ninfringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to\ndefend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant\namount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also receive inquiries\nand subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to\nour business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such\nmatters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things,\nmodification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and\nfinancial position.\nOur advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\nWe have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Our ability",
  "to generate advertising revenue is subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;\n\u2022\nthe quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;\n\u2022\nthe impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our\nads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\n\u2022\nchanges in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;\n\u2022\nadverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;\n\u2022\nchanges in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;\n\u2022\nregulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including\nregulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\n\u2022\nany liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service;\n7",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they\nmay be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are\nnot or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected\nand/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively\nquickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition\nincreases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights\nwhen obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient\nmanner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member\nacquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\nMusic and certain authors\u2019 performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we\nengage in negotiations with collection management organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in\nintellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable\nterms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely\nimpact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could\nadversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby\nadversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential\nliability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for\nCMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain\nmarkets.\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand\nand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with\nwhom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to\nenforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright,\nand patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or\nheld by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or\nmisappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third",
  "parties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and\nmethods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability\nto attract members may be adversely affected.\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our\nreputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent\nthird parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology,\nbusiness processes, and content.\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies. Our intellectual property rights extend to our\ntechnology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through our service, and consumer products,\n8",
  "Table of Contents\nexperiences, and marketing assets based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products\nand experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property\nrights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices\non a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our\nbusiness and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to\nintellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies\nare devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly\nclaim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against\nintellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and\nmanagement personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or\ninability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing\nmaterials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust\nour content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms\nacceptable to us.\nRisks Related to Information Technology\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including\nthose relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or\ndestruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could\nadversely impact our business.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and\nthose of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse\nweather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss,\ntelecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in\ngeneral, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or\nthe unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks\nsuch as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in\ninformation systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business\nhave experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss,\nmisuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and\nmany of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which\nmay increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial\nintelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose\nsensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or",
  "intellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could\nharm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our\ndata and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate,\ndetect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been\nand may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital\ncontent assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not\nhad a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the\nfuture. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or\notherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies\nchange and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service\noffering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely\naffect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party\u2019s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal\ninformation could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we\nutilize third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party\n9",
  "Table of Contents\ncontent delivery networks (\"CDN\") to help us stream content and offer games in high volume to Netflix members over the internet. Problems faced by us or\nour third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and\nregulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web\nServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\nAmazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a\n\"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services\nprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS\noperations to another cloud provider, any commercial disputes related to, disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and\nour business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in\nsuch a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations\ncould be adversely impacted.\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to\nrecommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer\nelectronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own CDN. To the extent Internet Service Providers (\u201cISPs\u201d) do not interconnect with our\nCDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN\u2019s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our\nstreaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our\nrecommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain\nmembers may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily\noperations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of\n\u201cbugs\u201d or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may\nbe impaired. Any harm to our members\u2019 devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our\nservice over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing,\nincluding meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and\nour member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and\neither charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,\nmany network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that\nconsumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help counterbalance these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide\npreferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively\nimpacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\nRisks Related to Privacy",
  "Risks Related to Privacy\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could\nadversely impact our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our advertising\noffering, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members and third parties, which may include personal information and other data. We are subject\nto laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal information, including but not limited to Regulation (EU)\n2016/679 (also known as the General Data Protection Regulation or \u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"). Any actual or perceived failure\nto comply with the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act/CPRA, other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or\nany perceived privacy rights violation, have and could in the future lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties,\nwhich to date have not been material but\n10",
  "Table of Contents\nmay result in significant damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market\nposition.\nOther businesses have been criticized by privacy groups and governmental bodies for attempts to link personal identities and other information to data\ncollected on the internet regarding users\u2019 browsing and other habits. Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings\nunder existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were\nto disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we\ncould face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal\nobligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization, data transfer and/or restrictions on\ndata export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt\nto these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by\nunauthorized persons.\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained\non our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on\nencryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members\u2019\ninformation. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience\nan unauthorized intrusion into our members\u2019 information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the\ninformation to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We have notified and may in the future be required to notify regulators about any actual or\nperceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the\nindividuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a\nbreach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain\npersonal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into\nour members\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger\nreputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity\nand results of operations.\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter\ninto multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as\nnon-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership\nbase (\u201cfixed cost\u201d) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such\ncommitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the\nmultiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be\nadversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the",
  "economy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce,\nwill typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the\nextent revenue growth does not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments\nand accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our\nflexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not\nfavorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-\nterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be\nadversely impacted.\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional\ncapital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any\ndisruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance\n11",
  "Table of Contents\nour existing indebtedness. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights,\npreferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering\ncould also negatively impact our stock price.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our\nfinancial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional\nindebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. Our ability to make payments on our debt and other\nobligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain\nfinancial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance\nor restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, including due to rising interest\nrates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or other changes in economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively\nimpacted, and any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further\nrestrict our business operations.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we had the equivalent of $15.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (\u201cNotes\u201d), some of which is\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $3 billion unsecured\nrevolving credit facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we had\napproximately $6.2 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the\nU.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are\nsignificant. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash\nflow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due, limit our ability to borrow additional funds, limit our flexibility to\nplan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors. For more\ninformation on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the\naccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and\nother risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve\nrisks that could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic\nsanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements or government action, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or\notherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and\ncriminal liability, or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;\n\u2022\napplication of foreign intellectual property laws, which requires the business to adapt to bespoke compliance rules, or changes to such laws, among",
  "other issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property\nrights;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in\ndetermining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is\nuncertain;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us\nto foreign currency exchange rate risk, and while we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\nexchange rates, the use of such hedging activities may not be effective in offsetting an adverse financial impact and may introduce or heighten\ncounterparty risk and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures;\n\u2022\nrates of inflation;\n\u2022\nprofit repatriation, currency control regulations and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022\ndiffering payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n12",
  "Table of Contents\n\u2022\ncensorship requirements that cause us to remove or edit popular content, leading to consumer disappointment, brand tarnishment or dissatisfaction\nwith our service;\n\u2022\nlow usage and/or penetration of internet-connected consumer electronic devices;\n\u2022\ndifferent and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws, including data localization and/or restrictions on data export, and\nlocal ownership requirements;\n\u2022\navailability of reliable broadband connectivity and wide area networks in targeted areas for expansion;\n\u2022\ndiffering laws and consumer understanding/attitudes regarding the illegality of piracy;\n\u2022\nnegative impacts from trade disputes; and\n\u2022\nimplementation of regulations designed to stimulate the local production of film and TV series in order to promote and preserve local culture and\neconomic activity, including local content quotas, investment obligations, and levies to support local film funds. For example, the EU revised its\nAudio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers\u2019\ncatalogs, and to require prominence of those works, and certain EU Member States have imposed additional investment obligations and levies.\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the\nexecution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results\nof our operations.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining\nour global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax positions and other tax attributes on a\nworldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state, local, and foreign\ntax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in\ndetermining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax\npositions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of\nincome and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely\nimpacted.\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement\npurposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits\npending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax\nobligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits\nare currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Human Resources\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may\nadversely affect our business.\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, members of our\nexecutive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development,\ntechnical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to maintain a\npositive reputation, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management\nteam, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or\nmaintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.",
  "Labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective\nbargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms\nthat are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form\nof strikes or work stoppages. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new\ncontent to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a\nsignificant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our\nability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\n13",
  "Table of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we\nhave announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.\nOur charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because\nthey:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors until our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a\nbusiness combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board\nof directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated\nExecutive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including\nthe following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by\noperating activities and free cash flow;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\n\u2022\nmarket volatility in general;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\n\u2022\nthe operating results of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nother risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such\nlitigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income\nand other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the\nad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the\nlack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts\nor investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial\nstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization\npattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various\nfactors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the\n14",
  "Table of Contents\npattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing or recognition of content amortization. If we revise such estimates it could\nresult in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively\nimpact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\nItem 1B.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C.\nCybersecurity\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable\ncybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate,\ninvestigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal\nreporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products\nbefore they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third\nparty risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all\ncircumstances that their efforts will be successful.\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-\nadopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards.\nWe conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration\nand vulnerability testing, red team exercises, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our\nsecurity measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security\ncontrols protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these\nassessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\nOur systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to\ninterruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members)\nand other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended\ndisclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service,\nsystems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and\nresults of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party\u2019s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject\nus to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The discontinuance of our DVD business had an immaterial impact on our operations and\nfinancial results.\n(2) A paid membership (also referred to as a paid subscription) is defined as a membership that has the right to receive Netflix service following sign-up and a method of\npayment being provided, and that is not part of a free trial or certain other promotions that may be offered by the Company to new or rejoining members. Certain members have\nthe option to add extra member sub accounts. These extra member sub accounts are not included in paid memberships. A membership is canceled and ceases to be reflected in\nthe above metrics as of the effective cancellation date. Voluntary cancellations generally become effective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary\ncancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become effective immediately. Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of\nsign-up as determined by the Company\u2019s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology.\n(3) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership\n(\u201cARM\u201d) absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nIn order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on ARM, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with\nforeign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency\npercentage change in ARM is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency ARM and the prior comparative period ARM. The impact of hedging\ngains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, our revenues would have been approximately $1,424\u00a0million higher,\nexcluding the impact of hedging and had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023. The unfavorable foreign\nexchange rate impacts in the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant\nprice increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction.\nOperating margin for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 increased six percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to\nrevenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues, sales and marketing, and technology and development expenses, coupled with\nlower general and administrative expenses.\n19",

See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nWe anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need,\nincluding for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development\nefforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such\nfinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights,\npreferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIn September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10\u00a0billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December\n2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15\u00a0billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be\neffected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to\nqualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar\npurchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing\nand actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and\nalternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. In the fiscal year ended\nDecember\u00a031, 2024, the Company repurchased 9,861,935 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $6,211\u00a0million (excluding the 1% excise tax on\nstock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of December\u00a031, 2024, $17.1\u00a0billion remains available for repurchases.\nOur primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related\ncosts, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period.\nInvestments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example,\nproduction costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to\nsignificantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations,\navailable funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve\nmonths and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations.

Once a\ntitle becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for\nunknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or\ncertain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual\nobligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year\nto more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4\nbillion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing\nrange is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license\nfees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n(2)\nDebt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.

  "Table of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the\ndate of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\"SEC\") has defined a company\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company\u2019s financial condition and results\nof operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical\naccounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nContent\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The\ncontent licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\nclassified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the\nfee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is\naccepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and\nproduction overhead.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in \u201cCost of revenues\u201d on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with\nthe month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more\naccelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its\nmonth of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require\nconsiderable management judgment.\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on\nproductions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive\nis earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title\u2019s launch, any\namounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in \u201cOther current assets\u201d or \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in\n\u201cContent assets, net\u201d) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in \u201cCost of revenues\u201d) on the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations.\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are\npredominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected\nusefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If\nsuch changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized\ncosts for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying",
  "amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is\nreduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of\nany tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past\noperating results, our forecast of future earnings and future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in\ndetermining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.\nActual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.\n26",
  "Table of Contents\nWe do not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is\nmore likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\nrecognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being\nrealized upon settlement. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change\nand the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates.\nSee Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe information set forth under Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \u201cBasis of Presentation and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\u201d is incorporated herein by reference.\nItem 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency\nfluctuations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt December\u00a031, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with\nthe prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d)\nwithin Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to\nNote 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates,\nincreasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on\nchanges in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue\nand 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily\nthe euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue\nand operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended\nDecember\u00a031, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same\nperiod of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine\npeso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to\nhedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on\nthese derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into \u201cRevenues\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same\nperiod the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December\u00a031, 2024 and December\u00a031, 2023, the amount recorded in\nAOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9\u00a0billion and $958\u00a0million lower, respectively. This adverse\nchange in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in\nearnings.",

These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate,\nthe effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and\ninitially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into \u201cCost of Revenues\u201d to offset the\nhedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2024 and December\u00a031, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been\napproximately $187\u00a0million and $71\u00a0million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign\ncurrency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\n27",
  "Table of Contents\nWe use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative\ninstruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\nWe designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative\ninstruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts\nrecognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the\nremeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December\u00a031, 2024, we\nbegan entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities\nthat are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect\nof foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and\nthe gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in \u201cInterest and other income (expense)\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also\ndesignate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The\ngains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in \u201cInterest and other income (expense),\u201d net\nwith the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of December\u00a031, 2024 and December\u00a031, 2023, income before\nincome taxes would have been approximately $38\u00a0million and $516\u00a0million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency\nexchange contracts and our net investment hedges. The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from $516\u00a0million as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2023 to $38\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign\nexchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the year ended December\u00a031, 2024.\nItem 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes listed in Part IV, Item\u00a015(a)(1) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are included\nimmediately following Part IV hereof and incorporated by reference herein.\nItem 9.\nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\n28",

Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of\nthe end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed\nby us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-\nChief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nOur management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not\nabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of\ncontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Netflix have been detected.\n\u00a0\n(b)\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the\nExchange Act). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2024. In making this\nassessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d) in Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013\nframework), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2024.

In our opinion,\nNetflix, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2024, based on the\nCOSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019\nequity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\u00a031, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January\u00a027, 2025 expressed\nan unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 27, 2025\n30",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the\nthree years in the period ended December\u00a031, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January\u00a027, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n35",
  "Table of Contents\nContent Amortization\nDescription of the Matter\nAs disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements \u201cOrganization and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d, the Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming (\u201cContent\u201d). The\nCompany amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.\nAuditing the amortization of the Company\u2019s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of\namortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical\nand forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization\nwould be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content\namortization process. For example, we tested controls over management\u2019s review of the content amortization method and\nthe significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated\nviewing patterns. We also tested management\u2019s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and\naccurate.\nTo test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method,\ntesting the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and\naccuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management\u2019s assumptions by comparing them to current\nviewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual\nresults. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that\ncould result from changes in the assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 27, 2025\n36",

Intercompany balances and transactions\nhave been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to\nsuch estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The\nCompany bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate\nreconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the\nnotes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requiring public\nentities to disclose information about their reportable segments\u2019 significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities\nwith a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and\nreconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See\nNote 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash\nequivalents.\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in \u201cInterest and other income (expense)\u201d in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in \u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d within Stockholders\u2019 equity in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of\nshort-term investments.\n42",
  "Table of Contents\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\nreviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company\u2019s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to\nsell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\nContent\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video\nentertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of\ncontent require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in\nrelated liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as \u201cContent assets, net\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the\nCompany capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the\ntitle is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production,\nincluding development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in \u201cCost of\nrevenues\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten\nyears, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and\nfilm amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized\nwithin four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The\nCompany's estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company's behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through\neligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the\nlocation the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company\u2019s\nservice. Upon a title\u2019s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in \u201cOther\ncurrent assets\u201d or \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a\nreduction to the cost basis of the Company\u2019s content assets (presented in \u201cContent assets, net\u201d) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as\npresented in \u201cCost of revenues\u201d) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company's business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and\nproduced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates\na change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such\nevent or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or\nfair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\nacquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection\nwith a business combination as of the acquisition date.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the",
  "estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\nTrade Receivables\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit\nlosses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company's primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership\nand revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that\n43",
  "Table of Contents\nare collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer\nelectronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide\naccess to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is\nestablished by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is\nrecognized as revenue.\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources.\nRevenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023,\nand 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners, including\nCE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other\nrelated expenses for personnel that support the Company's advertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include\npromotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising expenses were $1,779 million, $1,732 million and $1,586 million for the years\nended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred\ntax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax\neffects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a\ntax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note\n10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The\nCompany translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of\neach period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from\nthese translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders\u2019 equity on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nForeign exchange gains (losses) were $(18) million, $(293) million, and $282\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThese gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and\ncontent liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December\u00a031, 2024\nwere net of hedging impacts. No hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December\u00a031, 2023",
  "and 2022. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary\nobjective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in \u201cOther current assets\u201d and \u201cOther non-current assets\u201d) or\nliabilities (presented in \u201cAccrued expenses and other liabilities\u201d and \u201cOther non-current liabilities\u201d) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nCompany classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\nCash flow hedges\n44",
  "Table of Contents\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar, as well as the foreign exchange risk on forecasted transactions and firm commitments related to the licensing and production of foreign\ncurrency-denominated content assets. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and forecasted\ntransactions and generally have maturities of 36 months or less. The hedging contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency\nexchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\nThe gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue is initially reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and reclassified into \u201cRevenues\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the\nforecasted transaction affects earnings. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of firmly committed or forecasted\ntransactions related to the licensing and production of content assets is initially reported as a component of AOCI and reclassified into \u201cCost of Revenues\u201d on\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are\namortized. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the same category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash\nprovided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn the event that the likelihood of occurrence of the underlying forecasted transactions is determined to be probable not to occur, the gains or losses on the\nrelated cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI to \u201cInterest and other income (expense)\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of\ndedesignation.\nFair value hedges\nThe Company designates forward contracts as fair value hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its foreign-currency denominated debt. These\nhedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the Company may choose not to hedge the full\namount of its exposure. The gain or loss on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is\nrecognized in \u201cInterest and other income (expense),\u201d net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. The\nCompany excludes forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the initial value of the excluded component over the life of the\nhedging instrument in \u201cInterest and other income (expense)\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between changes in fair value of the\nexcluded component and the amount recognized in earnings is recognized as a component in AOCI. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the\nsame category as the cash flows for the underlying item being hedged within \"Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\" on the Consolidated\nStatements of Cash Flows.\nNet investment hedges\nThe Company designates a portion of its foreign currency-denominated debt as net investment hedges to manage the foreign exchange risk on its\ninvestment in certain foreign subsidiaries. These hedges may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements, and the\nCompany may choose not to hedge certain exposures. The gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI as part of\nthe cumulative translation adjustment on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accumulated gains and losses remain in AOCI until the hedged net\ninvestment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\nDerivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments\nThe Company enters into forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are\nnot denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments and\nmay reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange movements. The gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as\nhedging instruments are recorded in \u201cInterest and other income (expense)\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows related to these derivative\ninstruments are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the",

For certain executive officers, the Company grants restricted stock\nunits (\"RSUs\") and performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). Stock-based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the stock awards at the\ngrant date and is recognized, net of forfeitures, over the requisite service period.

  "Table of Contents\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized, as well as gift and other prepaid memberships that have not\nbeen fully redeemed. As of December 31, 2024, total deferred revenue was $1,521\u00a0million, the vast majority of which was related to membership fees billed\nthat are expected to be recognized as revenue within the next month. The remaining deferred revenue balance, which is related to gift cards and other prepaid\nmemberships, will be recognized as revenue over the period of service after redemption, which is expected to occur over the next 12 months. The $78 million\nincrease in deferred revenue as compared to the balance of $1,443\u00a0million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023, is a result of the increase in membership fees\nbilled due to increased memberships and price increases.\n3.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period.

  "Table of Contents\nLeases\nThe Company has entered into operating leases primarily for real estate. These leases generally have terms which range from 1 year to 15 years, and often\ninclude one or more options to renew. These renewal terms can extend the lease term from 1 year to 20 years, and are included in the lease term when it is\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. These operating leases are included in \"Other non-current assets\" on the Company's Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, and represent the Company\u2019s right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The Company\u2019s obligations to make lease payments are\nincluded in \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" and \"Other non-current liabilities\" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. \u00a0Operating lease right-\nof-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company has\nentered into various short-term operating leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. These leases are not recorded on the Company's Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. All operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Because the rate implicit in each lease is not readily\ndeterminable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. The Company has certain contracts for\nreal estate which may contain lease and non-lease components which it has elected to treat as a single lease component.\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n\u00a0\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n468,282\u00a0\n$\n430,856\u00a0\n$\n413,664\u00a0\nShort-term lease cost\n197,691\u00a0\n207,822\u00a0\n194,764\u00a0\nTotal lease cost\n$\n665,973\u00a0\n$\n638,678\u00a0\n$\n608,428\u00a0\nInformation related to the Company's operating right-of-use assets and related operating lease liabilities were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities\n$\n509,296\u00a0\n$\n451,525\u00a0\n$\n413,034\u00a0\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease obligations\n442,391\u00a0\n196,639\u00a0\n252,393\u00a0\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(in thousands, except lease term and discount rate)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n$\n2,102,310\u00a0\n$\n2,076,899\u00a0\nCurrent operating lease liabilities\n$\n428,482\u00a0\n$\n383,312\u00a0\nNon-current operating lease liabilities\n1,983,688\u00a0\n2,046,801\u00a0\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n2,412,170\u00a0\n$\n2,430,113\u00a0\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n6.9 years\n7.5 years\nWeighted-average discount rate\n3.5\u00a0%\n3.3\u00a0%\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December\u00a031, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\n50",

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are\ntranslated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and\nemployment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the\nCompany enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of\nthe reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of\nsuch license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the\nunknown obligations are expected to be significant.\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee\nrelations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of\ncomplex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto\nunfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the\nCompany's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at\nthis time. The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\nNon-Income Taxes\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits\nprimarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from\nexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-\nincome tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect\nto these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with\nBrazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400\u00a0million, which is expected to increase over time.\n56",

In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on\nthe other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse\nagainst third parties for certain payments. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that\nwill require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The\nterms of such obligations vary.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the\nconditional nature of the Company\u2019s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. No amount has been accrued in\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification guarantees.\n57",

As of\nDecember\u00a031, 2024, the valuation allowance of $540\u00a0million was primarily related to California R&D tax credits, state net operating loss carryforwards, and\nforeign tax credits that the Company does not expect to realize.\nAt December\u00a031, 2024, we have not provided for applicable U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes on an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign\nearnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest.

The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December\u00a031, 2024\nand 2023 was $44\u00a0million and $28\u00a0million, respectively.\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and\nis subject to examination for 2019 through 2023. The Company is also generally subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions for years\n2017 through 2023. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and believes that its tax positions will\nmore likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. The Company believes that adequate\namounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change\nwithin the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Employee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees.

During the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company\u2019s matching contributions totaled $128 million, $114\nmillion and $102 million, respectively.\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-\nrepresented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by\nthe Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses\nto stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii)\nif a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining\nparticipating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and\nretired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively:\n63",

  "EXHIBIT 19.1\nInsider Trading Policy\nIn order to take an active role in the prevention of insider trading violations by executive officers, directors, employees and other related individuals of Netflix,\nInc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) and its subsidiaries, the Company has adopted this Insider Trading Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d).\nStatement of Intent\nThe Company opposes the misuse of material nonpublic information in the trading of securities and it is the intent of this Policy to implement procedures\ndesigned to prevent trading based on material nonpublic information regarding the Company, including any of its subsidiaries. The Company also wishes to\ndiscourage certain trading in its securities by its executive officers, directors, employees and other related individuals that may be contrary to the interests of\nour shareholders. The term \"executive officer\" herein shall have the same meaning as the term \u201cofficer\u201d as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nIt is also Company policy to comply with applicable securities laws concerning trading in Company securities on the Company\u2019s behalf.\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information\nIt is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a substantial likelihood that it\nwould be considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision regarding transactions of the Company\u2019s securities. Put another way,\nthere must be a substantial likelihood that the information would be viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of\ninformation available in the market concerning the Company. Either positive or negative information may be material.\nQuestions concerning whether nonpublic information is material can be directed to the Compliance Officer.\nCovered Parties\nThe Policy covers executive officers, directors and all employees of, or consultants or contractors to, the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as their\nimmediate family members who reside with them, anyone else who lives in their household, and any other individuals who do not live in their household but\nwhose transactions in Company securities are directed by them or are subject to their influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with them\nbefore trading in Company securities) (\u201cInsiders\u201d). This Policy applies to trades of Company securities in which an Insider has any \u201cbeneficial\u201d or other\ninterest, or over which they exercise investment control.\nCovered Transactions\nThis Policy applies to all transactions in the Company\u2019s securities, including common stock, options for common stock and any other securities the Company\nmay issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures, as well as to derivative securities relating to the Company\u2019s\nsecurities, whether or not issued by the Company, such as publicly-traded options. Transactions subject to this Policy include purchases, sales and bona fide\ngifts of the Company\u2019s securities (which may include gifts to trusts for estate planning purposes, as well as donations to a charitable organization).\n- 1 -",
  "Prohibited Transactions\nNo Insider shall engage in any transaction involving the Company\u2019s securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during any period commencing\nwith the date that the Insider possesses material nonpublic information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries, and ending at the beginning of the trading\nday following the date of public disclosure of that information, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material.\nNo Insider shall disclose (\u201ctip\u201d) material nonpublic information about the Company or its subsidiaries to any other person where such information may be used\nby such person to their profit by trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates, nor shall such Insider or related person make\nrecommendations or express opinions on the basis of material nonpublic information as to trading in the Company\u2019s securities.\nNo Insider shall engage in any transaction involving another company\u2019s securities while in possession of material nonpublic information about such company\nwhen that information is obtained in the course of employment with, or the performance of services on behalf of, the Company and the other company is a\nbusiness partner of the Company such as one with which the Company is discussing a proposed transaction, collaborator, customer, distributor, vendor or\nsupplier.\nExcept for participation in the Company\u2019s stock option program, no executive officer or director shall, at any time, engage in any transactions involving any\nhedging or derivatives of Company securities, including trading in futures and derivative securities and engaging in hedging activities relating to our securities,\nincluding exchange traded options, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds or other arrangements or instruments designed to\nhedge or offset decreases in the market value of our securities, provided that it shall not be a violation of this Policy for an executive officer or director to\nengage in any such transaction initiated prior to March 4, 2020.\nExcept as may otherwise be authorized under this Policy, executive officers and directors shall not initiate any transactions subsequent to March 4, 2020 that\ninvolve pledging any Company securities as collateral for a loan or holding them as security in a margin account.\nProblematic Transactions\nWhile employees (other than executive officers, except as otherwise provided) are not prohibited by this Policy from using Company securities as collateral for\nloans or in margin accounts with respect to the Company\u2019s securities or engaging in transactions involving hedging or derivatives of Company securities,\nincluding by means of exchange traded options, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds or other arrangements or instruments\ndesigned to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of our securities, the Company discourages employees from such activity because, among other\nproblems, these types of transactions may result in transactions in Company securities occurring outside the Open Window (defined below). Limit orders with\nbrokers should not extend beyond any Open Window and be cancellable upon an imposition of a black-out period. Employees interested in trading outside of\nthe Open Window should look into adopting a 10b5-1 trading plan, as described below. Exercising stock options issued pursuant to the Company\u2019s stock option\nplan, as otherwise permitted under this Policy, is not considered problematic.\nThe Company\u2019s Trading Window\nThe Company has determined that all executive officers, directors, and those other persons identified on Attachment 1 (as may be amended from time to time\nby the Compliance Officer), shall be prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise effecting transactions in any stock or other securities of the Company or\nderivative securities thereof EXCEPT during the following trading window:\n- 2 -",
  "Beginning at the open of market on the trading day following the date of public disclosure of the Company\u2019s financial results for a preceding calendar\nquarter or year and ending at the close of market on the 10  day of the second calendar month of the current calendar quarter (the \u201cOpen Window\u201d).\nIn addition, the Company, through the Compliance Officer, may authorize longer or additional trading windows in which buying, selling, gifting or otherwise\neffecting transactions in the Company\u2019s securities would be permitted pursuant to this Policy as if it were the \u201cOpen Window.\u201d Similarly, the Company,\nthrough the Compliance Officer, may impose special black-out periods during which certain persons will be prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise\neffecting transactions in the Company\u2019s securities, even though the trading window would otherwise be open. If a special black-out period is imposed, the\nCompany will notify affected individuals, who should thereafter not engage in any transaction involving the Company\u2019s securities and should not disclose to\nothers the fact of such suspension of trading.\nIt should be noted that even during the Open Window, any person possessing material nonpublic information should not engage in any transactions in the\nCompany\u2019s securities until the beginning of the trading day following the date of public disclosure of such information, whether or not the Company has\nrecommended a suspension of trading to that person.\nPre-Clearance of Trades and Other Transactions\nAll executive officers and directors of the Company and other persons designated by the Compliance Officer as being subject to pre-clearance requirements\nmust refrain from trading in or gifting the Company\u2019s securities, even during the Open Window, without first contacting the Company\u2019s Compliance Officer\nand obtaining pre-clearance to commence trading in the Company\u2019s securities.\nIn addition, all executive officers and directors are required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations, which set forth\nreporting obligations as well as limitations on \u201cshort swing\u201d transactions. The Company is available to assist in filing Section 16 reporting; however, the\nobligation to comply with Section 16 is personal. Please direct any inquiries concerning compliance to the Compliance Officer. Executive officers and directors\nwho wish to pledge the Company's stock as collateral after March 4, 2020 must first contact the Company's Compliance Officer to request an exemption and\npre-clearance to enter into the transaction.\nAdoption and Effect of 10b5-1 Trading Plans\nThe Company permits all directors, executive officers and employees to adopt trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act\n(\u201c10b5-1 trading plans\u201d). A 10b5-1 trading plan must comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and may only be adopted or amended in an Open Window\nand when the person adopting the plan is not otherwise in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company, its subsidiaries or its securities. All\n10b5-1 trading plans must be pre-approved by the Compliance Officer or his delegate. The restrictions on trading set forth in this Policy shall not apply to\ntrades made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan. More information concerning trading plans is available from the Compliance Officer.\nExemptions from this Policy\nThe exercise of stock options under the Company\u2019s stock option plan with a cash payment of the exercise price is exempt from this Policy, since the other party\nto these transactions is the Company itself and the price does not vary with the market, but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement, or the Company\nwithholding a portion of the shares underlying the options to satisfy exercise price or tax withholding requirements. This exemption does not\nth\n- 3 -",
  "apply to the sale of any shares issued upon such exercise and it does not apply to a cashless exercise of options, which is accomplished by a sale of a portion of\nthe shares issued upon exercise of an option.\nPost-Termination Transactions\nIf a person is in possession of material nonpublic information when their service terminates, that individual should not trade in Company securities until that\ninformation has become public or is no longer material.\nConsequences for Violation\nDirectors and employees who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, which may include ineligibility for future\nparticipation in the Company\u2019s equity stock option and other incentive plans or termination of employment or service.\nPursuant to U.S. federal and state securities laws, Insiders may be subject to criminal and civil fines and penalties as well as imprisonment for engaging in\ntransactions in the Company\u2019s securities at a time when they are in possession of material nonpublic information regarding the Company or its subsidiaries. In\naddition, Insiders may be liable for improper transactions by any person (commonly referred to as a \u201ctippee\u201d) to whom they have disclosed material nonpublic\ninformation regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on the basis of such information as\nto trading in the Company\u2019s securities.\nIndividual Responsibility\nEvery executive officer, director and employee, consultant and contractor has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy, and the applicable laws\nof their jurisdiction. An Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company\u2019s securities even if he or she planned to make the\ntransaction before learning of the material nonpublic information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego\nanticipated profit by waiting. Trading in the Company\u2019s securities during the trading window (including with pre-clearance) should not be considered a\n\u201csafe harbor,\u201d and all directors, executive officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times.\nCompliance Officer\n\u25cf\nThe Company\u2019s Chief Legal Officer shall serve as the Insider Trading Compliance Officer (the \u201cCompliance Officer\u201d). The duties of the Compliance\nOfficer shall include, but not be limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nPre-clearing transactions as required under this Policy.\n\u25cf\nAssisting, as requested, in the preparation and filing of Section 16 reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5) for Section 16 reporting persons.\n\u25cf\nServing as the designated recipient at the Company of copies of reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Section 16 reporting\npersons under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\n\u25cf\nCirculating the Policy (and/or a summary thereof) to all employees, including Section 16 reporting persons, on an annual basis.\n\u25cf\nAssisting the Company in implementation of the Policy.\n\u25cf\nCoordinating with Company counsel regarding compliance activities with respect to Rule 144 requirements and regarding changing requirements and\nrecommendations for compliance with Section 16 of the Exchange Act and insider trading laws to ensure that the Policy is amended as necessary to\ncomply with such requirements.\n- 4 -",
  "The duties may be delegated by the Compliance Officer to such other individuals as the Compliance Officer deems appropriate.\n* * * * *\nAttachment 1\nPersons subject to trading window restrictions\nInsiders, as defined in the Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy, except for the following:\n\u25cf\nEmployees, contractors and consultants who are employed or retained through a direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company that is specifically and\nsolely engaged in the production of original content and not otherwise included as a matter of business practice in the distribution of corporate\ninformation about the Company and its financial performance, unless such person has been notified in writing by the Compliance Officer that the\ntrading window applies to them.\n\u25cf\nEmployees of subsidiaries that are not integrated into the Company's email systems and/or who do not have access to consolidated financial data.\n- 5 -",
