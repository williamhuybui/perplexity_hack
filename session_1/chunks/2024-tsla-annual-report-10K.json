We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous\nefforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial and other services tailored to our products.\nOur mission is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We believe that this mission, along with our engineering\nexpertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.\nSegment Information\nWe operate as two reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nThe automotive segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of high-performance fully electric\nvehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment also includes services and other, which\nincludes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services\nrevenue and retail merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales\nand leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives.\nOur Products and Services\nAutomotive\nWe currently manufacture five different consumer vehicles \u2013 the Model 3, Y, S, X and Cybertruck. Model 3 is a four-door mid-\nsize sedan that we designed for manufacturability with a base price for mass-market appeal. Model Y is a compact sport utility vehicle\n(\u201cSUV\u201d) built on the Model 3 platform with seating for up to seven adults. Model S is a four-door full-size sedan and Model X is a\nmid-size SUV with seating for up to seven adults. Model S and Model X feature the highest performance characteristics and longest\nranges that we offer in a sedan and SUV, respectively. In November 2023, we entered the consumer pickup truck market with first\ndeliveries of the Cybertruck, a full-size electric pickup truck with a stainless steel exterior that has the utility and strength of a truck\nwhile featuring the speed of a sports car.\nIn 2022, we also began early production and deliveries of a commercial electric vehicle, the Tesla Semi. We have planned\nelectric vehicles to address additional vehicle markets, and continue leveraging developments in our proprietary Full Self-Driving\n(\u201cFSD\u201d) (Supervised) features, including through our purpose-built Robotaxi product - Cybercab, and battery cell and other\ntechnologies. For purposes of this filing, use of the term \u201cFSD (Supervised)\u201d includes the equivalent naming convention, \u201cFSD\n(Capability)\u201d that is used in the European, Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nPowerwall and Megapack are our lithium-ion battery energy storage products. Powerwall, which we sell directly to customers,\nas well as through channel partners, is designed to store energy at a home or small commercial facility. Megapack is an energy storage\nsolution for commercial, industrial, utility and energy generation customers, multiple of which may be grouped together to form larger\ninstallations of gigawatt hours (\u201cGWh\u201d) or greater capacity.\nWe also continue to develop software capabilities for remotely controlling and dispatching our energy storage systems across a\nwide range of markets and applications, including through our real-time energy control and optimization platforms.\n2\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n6/157",

  "Table of Contents\nSolar Energy Offerings\nWe sell retrofit solar energy systems to customers and channel partners. We purchase most of the components for our retrofit\nsolar energy systems from multiple sources to ensure competitive pricing and adequate supply. We also design and manufacture certain\ncomponents for our solar energy products.\nWe sell our Solar Roof, which combines premium glass roof tiles with energy generation, to consumers, including through\nchannel customers. We continue to improve our installation capability and efficiency, including through collaboration with real estate\ndevelopers and builders on new homes.\nTechnology\nAutomotive\nBattery and Powertrain\nOur core vehicle technology competencies include powertrain engineering and manufacturing and our ability to design vehicles\nthat utilize the unique advantages of an electric powertrain. We have designed our proprietary powertrain systems to be adaptable,\nefficient, reliable and cost-effective while withstanding the rigors of an automotive environment. We offer dual motor powertrain\nvehicles, which use two electric motors to maximize traction and performance in an all-wheel drive configuration, as well as vehicle\npowertrain technology featuring three electric motors for further increased performance in certain versions of Model S and Model X,\nCybertruck and the Tesla Semi.\nWe maintain extensive testing and R&D capabilities for battery cells, packs and systems, and have built an expansive body of\nknowledge on lithium-ion cell chemistry types and performance characteristics. In order to enable a greater supply of cells for our\nproducts with higher energy density at lower costs, we have developed a new proprietary lithium-ion battery cell and improved\nmanufacturing processes.\nVehicle Control and Infotainment Software\nThe performance and safety systems of our vehicles and their battery packs utilize sophisticated control software. Control\nsystems in our vehicles optimize performance, customize vehicle behavior, manage charging and control all infotainment functions. We\ndevelop almost all of this software, including most of the user interfaces, internally and update our vehicles\u2019 software regularly through\nover-the-air updates.\nSelf-Driving Development and Artificial Intelligence\nWe have expertise in developing technologies, systems and software to enable self-driving vehicles using primarily vision-based\ntechnologies. Our FSD Computer runs our neural networks in our vehicles, and we are also developing additional computer hardware\nto better enable the massive amounts of field data captured by our vehicles to continually train and improve these neural networks for\nreal-world performance.\nCurrently, we offer in our vehicles certain advanced driver assist systems under our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) options.\nAlthough at present, same as in the past, the driver is responsible for remaining fully engaged in the driving operation, our systems\nprovide safety and convenience functionality that can relieve drivers of many tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel\nmuch like the system that airplane pilots use, when conditions permit. As with other vehicle systems, we improve these functions in our\nvehicles over time through over-the-air software updates.\nIn 2025, we intend to begin launching our Robotaxi business, a ride-hailing network that will eventually operate fully\nautonomous vehicles. We expect this business will open access to a new customer base even as modes of transportation evolve. We\nbelieve our capabilities and advancements in AI, including the deployment of Cortex, our training cluster at Gigafactory Texas,\ndifferentiates us from our competitors.\nWe are also applying our artificial intelligence learnings from self-driving technology to the field of robotics, such as through\nOptimus, a robotic humanoid in development, which is controlled by the same AI system.\n3\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n8/157",

  "Table of Contents\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Products\nWe leverage many of the component-level technologies from our vehicles in our energy storage products. By taking a modular\napproach to the design of battery systems, we can optimize manufacturing capacity of our energy storage products. Additionally, our\nexpertise in power electronics enables our battery systems to interconnect with electricity grids while providing fast-acting systems for\npower injection and absorption. We have also developed software to remotely control and dispatch our energy storage systems.\nSolar Energy Systems\nWe have engineered Solar Roof over numerous iterations to combine aesthetic appeal and durability with power generation. The\nefficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which incorporates our power electronics technologies. We\ndesigned both products to integrate with Powerwall.\nDesign and Engineering\nAutomotive\nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components\nand systems. Our team has significant experience in computer-aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations,\nwhich reduces the product development time of new models. We have also achieved complex engineering feats in stamping, casting\nand thermal systems, and developed a method to integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs\nto optimize manufacturability, weight, range and cost characteristics.\nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while taking action to localize our vehicle designs and production\nfor particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our\ncapabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations\nmodeling these capabilities prior to construction.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design, engineer, manufacture and install\nenergy generating and storage products and components, including at the residential through utility scale. For example, the modular\ndesign of our Megapack utility-scale battery line is intended to significantly reduce the amount of assembly required in the field. We\nalso customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their\nspecific needs.\nSales and Marketing\nHistorically, we have been able to achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We\ncontinue to monitor our public narrative and brand, and tailor our marketing efforts accordingly, including through investments in\ncustomer education and advertising as necessary.\nAutomotive\nDirect Sales\nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores. In some\njurisdictions, we also have galleries to educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not transact in the sale\nof vehicles. We believe this infrastructure enables us to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, educate\nconsumers about electric vehicles, make our vehicles more affordable, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand and obtain rapid\ncustomer feedback.\nWe reevaluate our sales strategy both globally and at a location-by-location level from time to time to optimize our sales\nchannels. However, sales of vehicles in the automobile industry tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to volatility\nfrom time to time.\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n10/157",

  "Table of Contents\nUsed Vehicle Sales\nOur used vehicle business supports new vehicle sales by integrating the trade-in of a customer\u2019s existing Tesla or non-Tesla\nvehicle with the sale of a new Tesla vehicle. The Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles we acquire as trade-ins, along with vehicles returned\nupon lease-end are subsequently remarketed, either directly by us or through third parties.\nPublic Charging\nWe have a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are our industrial-grade, high-speed vehicle chargers. Where\npossible, we co-locate Superchargers with our solar and energy storage systems to reduce costs and promote renewable power.\nSupercharger stations are typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow vehicle owners the\nability to enjoy quick, reliable charging along an extensive network with convenient stops. Use of the Supercharger network either\nrequires payment of a fee or is free under certain sales programs. In November 2021, we began to offer Supercharger access to non-\nTesla vehicles in certain locations in support of our mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy, and in November\n2022, we opened up our previously proprietary charging connector as the North American Charging Standard (NACS). This enables\nelectric vehicles and charging stations to interoperate \u2014 which makes charging easier and more efficient for everyone and advances\nour mission to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. Following this, all major automotive companies announced their\nadoption of NACS in certain markets, with their access to the Supercharger network beginning in phases in 2024 and their production\nof NACS vehicles beginning no later than 2025. We also engaged SAE International to govern NACS as an industry standard, now\nnamed J3400. We continue to monitor and increase our network of Tesla Superchargers in anticipation of future demand.\nWe also work with a wide variety of hospitality, retail and public destinations, as well as businesses with commuting employees,\nto offer additional charging options for our customers, as well as single-family homeowners and multi-family residential entities, to\ndeploy home charging solutions.\nIn-App Upgrades\nAs our vehicles are capable of being updated remotely over-the-air, our customers may purchase additional paid options and\nfeatures through the Tesla app or through the in-vehicle user interface. We expect that this functionality will also allow us to offer\ncertain options and features on a subscription basis in the future.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nWe market and sell our solar and energy storage products to residential, commercial and industrial customers and utilities\nthrough a variety of channels, including through our website, stores and galleries, as well as through our network of channel partners,\nand in the case of some commercial customers, through PPA transactions. We emphasize simplicity, standardization and accessibility to\nmake it easy and cost-effective for customers to adopt clean energy, while reducing our customer acquisition costs.\nService and Warranty\nAutomotive\nService\nWe provide service for our electric vehicles at our company-owned service locations and through Tesla Mobile Service\ntechnicians who perform work remotely at customers\u2019 homes or other locations. Servicing the vehicles ourselves allows us to identify\nproblems and implement solutions and improvements faster than traditional automobile manufacturers and their dealer networks. The\nconnectivity of our vehicles also allows us to diagnose and remedy many problems remotely and proactively.\nVehicle Limited Warranties and Extended Service Plans\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s limited warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to consumers, which may\ninclude limited warranties on certain components, specific types of damage or battery capacity retention.

We also mitigate risk by maintaining safety\nstock for key parts and assemblies and die banks for components with lengthy procurement lead times.\nOur products use various raw materials including aluminum, steel, cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper. Pricing for these materials\nis governed by market conditions and may fluctuate due to various factors outside of our control, such as supply and demand and\nmarket speculation. We strive to execute long-term supply contracts for such materials at competitive pricing when feasible, and we\ncurrently believe that we have adequate access to raw materials supplies to meet the needs of our operations.\nGovernmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations\nGlobally, the ownership of our products by our customers is impacted by various government credits, incentives, and policies.\nOur business and products are also subject to numerous governmental regulations that vary among jurisdictions.\nThe operation of our business is also impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. See Note\n2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for further details.\nPrograms and Incentives\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d) was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years\nbeginning after December 31, 2022, and remains subject to future guidance releases. The IRA includes multiple incentives to promote\nclean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, including through providing tax credits to\nconsumers. For example, under current legislation, qualifying Tesla customers may receive up to $7,500 in federal tax credits for the\npurchase of qualified electric vehicles in the U.S. through 2032.\nAutomotive Regulatory Credits\nWe earn tradable credits in the operation of our business under various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles (\u201cZEVs\u201d),\ngreenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with\nemission standards and other regulatory requirements. Sales of these credits are recognized within automotive regulatory credits\nrevenue in our consolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnergy Storage System Incentives and Policies\nWhile the regulatory regime for energy storage projects is still under development, there are various policies, incentives and\nfinancial mechanisms at the federal, state and local levels that support the adoption of energy storage.\nFor example, energy storage systems that are charged using solar energy may be eligible for the solar energy-related U.S. federal\ntax credits described below. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) has also taken steps to enable the participation of\nenergy storage in wholesale energy markets. In addition, California and a number of other states have adopted procurement targets for\nenergy storage, and behind-the-meter energy storage systems qualify for funding under the California Self Generation Incentive\nProgram. Our customers primarily benefit directly under these programs. In certain instances our customers may transfer such credits to\nus as contract consideration. In such transactions, they are included as a component of energy generation and storage revenues in our\nconsolidated statements of operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPursuant to the IRA, under Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201dIRC\u201d), standalone energy storage\ntechnology is eligible for a tax credit between 6% and 50% of qualified expenditures, regardless of the source of energy, which may be\nclaimed by our customers for storage systems they purchase or by us for arrangements where we own the systems. These tax credits are\nprimarily for the benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\n7\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n16/157",
  "Table of Contents\nSolar Energy System Incentives and Policies\nU.S. federal, state and local governments have established various policies, incentives and financial mechanisms to reduce the\ncost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy. These incentives include tax credits, cash grants, tax abatements and\nrebates.\nIn particular, pursuant to the IRA, Sections 48, 48E and 25D of the IRC provides a tax credit between 6% and 70% of qualified\ncommercial or residential expenditures for solar energy systems, which may be claimed by our customers for systems they purchase, or\nby us for arrangements where we own the systems for properties that meet statutory requirements. These tax credits are primarily for\nthe direct benefit of our customers and are currently scheduled to phase-out starting in 2032 or later.\nRegulations\nVehicle Safety and Testing\nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d), including\nall applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (\u201cFMVSS\u201d) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our\nvehicles, such as crash-worthiness and occupant protection requirements. Our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our\nvehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions; however, FMVSS are subject to\nchange from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA\nbumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S.\nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel\nEconomy standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing,\nEarly Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, a Standing\nGeneral Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems, and\nadditional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile\nInformation and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the\nmanufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy\nratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d), and New Car\nAssessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.\nOur vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations.\nMany of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those\nregulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features.\nSelf-Driving Vehicles\nGenerally, laws pertaining to self-driving vehicles are evolving globally, and in some cases may create restrictions on features or\nvehicle designs that we develop. While there are currently no federal U.S. regulations pertaining specifically to self-driving vehicles or\nself-driving equipment, NHTSA has published recommended guidelines on self-driving vehicles, apart from the FMVSS and\nmanufacturer reporting obligations, and retains the authority to investigate and/or take action on the safety or compliance of any\nvehicle, equipment or features operating on public roads. Certain U.S. states also have legal restrictions on the operation, registration or\nlicensure of self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This regulatory patchwork increases the legal complexity\nwith respect to self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\nIn markets that follow the regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (\u201cECE markets\u201d), some\nrequirements restrict the design of advanced driver-assistance or self-driving features, which can compromise or prevent their use\nentirely. Other applicable laws, both current and proposed, may hinder or complicate the path and timeline to introducing self-driving\nvehicles for sale and use in the markets where they apply.\nOther key markets, including China, continue to consider self-driving regulation. Any implemented regulations may differ\nmaterially from the U.S. and ECE markets, which may further increase the legal complexity of self-driving vehicles and limit or\nprevent certain features.\n8\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n17/157",
  "Table of Contents\nAutomobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation\nIn the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of automobiles, and generally require motor\nvehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws\nin such states do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they\notherwise restrict a manufacturer\u2019s ability to deliver or perform warranty repairs on vehicles. To sell vehicles to residents of states\nwhere we are not licensed as a dealer, we generally conduct the sale out of the state. In certain such states, we have opened \u201cgalleries\u201d\nthat serve an educational purpose and where sales may not occur.\nSome automobile dealer trade associations have both challenged the legality of our operations in court and used administrative\nand legislative processes to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing stores or expand to new locations. Certain dealer\nassociations have also actively lobbied state licensing agencies and legislators to interpret existing laws or enact new laws in ways not\nfavorable to our ownership and operation of our own retail and service locations. We expect such challenges to continue, and we intend\nto actively fight any such efforts.\nBattery Safety and Testing\nOur battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of \u201cdangerous goods,\u201d defined\nto include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with\nsuch regulations.\nWe use lithium-ion cells in our high voltage battery packs in our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and\ndisposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add\nadditional requirements in the future. We have agreements with third party battery recycling companies to recycle our battery packs,\nand we are also piloting our own recycling technology.\nSolar Energy\u2014General\nWe are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity.\nTo operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale\nequipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, have faced regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.\nSolar Energy\u2014Net Metering\nMost states in the U.S. make net energy metering, or net metering, available to solar customers. Net metering typically allows\nsolar customers to interconnect their solar energy systems to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchases by receiving a\nbill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid. In certain jurisdictions, regulators or\nutilities have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so.\nCompetition\nAutomotive\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future as a\nsignificant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are\nreported to have plans to enter the electric vehicle market.\nWe believe that our vehicles compete in the market based on both their traditional segment classification as well as their\npropulsion technology. For example, Cybertruck competes with other pickup trucks, Model S and Model X compete primarily with\npremium sedans and premium SUVs and Model 3 and Model Y compete with small to medium-sized sedans and compact SUVs, all of\nwhich are extremely competitive markets. Competing products typically include internal combustion vehicles from more established\nautomobile manufacturers; however, many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to\nenter the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles. Overall, we believe these announcements and vehicle introductions\npromote the development of the electric vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of electric vehicles relative to internal\ncombustion vehicles. Many major automobile manufacturers have electric vehicles available today in major markets including the U.S.,\nChina and Europe, and other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles. In addition,\nseveral manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions.\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n18/157",

  "Table of Contents\nWe believe that there is also increasing competition for our vehicle offerings as a platform for delivering self-driving\ntechnologies, charging solutions and other features and services, and we expect to compete in this developing market through continued\nprogress on our Autopilot, FSD (Supervised) and neural network capabilities, Supercharger network and our infotainment offerings.\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nEnergy Storage Systems\nThe market for energy storage products is also highly competitive, and both established and emerging companies have\nintroduced products that are similar to our product portfolio or that are alternatives to the elements of our systems. We compete with\nthese companies based on price, energy density and efficiency. We believe that the specifications and features of our products, our\nstrong brand and the modular, scalable nature of our energy storage products give us a competitive advantage in our markets.\nSolar Energy Systems\nThe primary competitors to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility companies that supply energy to our\npotential customers. We compete with these traditional utility companies primarily based on price and the ease by which customers can\nswitch to electricity generated by our solar energy systems. We also compete with solar energy companies that provide products and\nservices similar to ours. Many solar energy companies only install solar energy systems, while others only provide financing for these\ninstallations. We believe we have a significant expansion opportunity with our offerings and that the regulatory environment is\nincreasingly conducive to the adoption of renewable energy systems.\nIntellectual Property\nWe place a strong emphasis on our innovative approach and proprietary designs which bring intrinsic value and uniqueness to\nour product portfolio. As part of our business, we seek to protect the underlying intellectual property rights of these innovations and\ndesigns such as with respect to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidential information and other measures, including\nthrough employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and other contractual arrangements. For example, we place a high priority\non obtaining patents to provide the broadest and strongest possible protection to enable our freedom to operate our innovations and\ndesigns across all of our products and technologies as well as to protect and defend our product portfolio. We have also adopted a\npatent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing our patents through\nactivity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith. We made this pledge in order\nto encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting ourselves, other\ncompanies making electric vehicles and the world.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human Capital Resources\nESG\nThe very purpose of Tesla's existence is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. We believe the world cannot\nreduce carbon emissions without addressing both energy generation and consumption, and we are designing and manufacturing a\ncomplete energy and transportation ecosystem to achieve this goal. As we expand, we are building each new factory to be more\nefficient and sustainably designed than the previous one, including with respect to per-unit waste reduction and resource consumption,\nincluding water and energy usage. We are focused on further enhancing sustainability of operations outside of our direct control,\nincluding reducing the carbon footprint of our supply chain.\nWe are committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials, and our suppliers are required to provide evidence of\nmanagement systems that ensure social, environmental and sustainability best practices in their own operations, as well as to\ndemonstrate a commitment to responsible sourcing into their supply chains. We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to child or\nforced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers and we look to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Due\nDiligence Guidelines to inform our process and use feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually\nimprove. We are also driving safety in our own factories by focusing on worker engagement. Our incidents per vehicle continue to drop\neven as our production volumes increase. We also strive to be an employer of choice by offering compelling, impactful jobs with best\nin-industry benefits.\n10\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n20/157",

We will also need to hire, train and compensate skilled employees\nto operate these facilities. Bottlenecks and other unexpected challenges such as those we experienced in the past may arise during our\nproduction ramps, and we must address them promptly while continuing to improve manufacturing processes and reducing costs. If we\nare not successful in achieving these goals, we could face delays in establishing and/or sustaining our product ramps or be unable to\nmeet our related cost and profitability targets.\nWe have experienced, and may also experience similar future delays in launching and/or ramping production of our energy\nstorage products and Solar Roof; new product versions or variants; new vehicles; and future products, features and services based on\nartificial intelligence. Likewise, we may encounter delays with the design, construction and regulatory or other approvals necessary to\nbuild and bring online future manufacturing facilities and products. In addition, as we continue to develop our artificial intelligence\nservices and products, we may face many additional challenges, including the availability and cost of energy, processing power\nlimitations and the substantial power requirements for our data centers.\nAny delay or other complication in ramping the production of our current products or the development, manufacture, launch and\nproduction ramp of our future products, features and services, or in doing so cost-effectively and with high quality, may harm our\nbrand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur suppliers may fail to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes that are acceptable to us, or\nwe may be unable to manage these components effectively.\nOur products contain thousands of parts purchased globally from hundreds of suppliers, including single-source direct suppliers,\nwhich exposes us to multiple potential sources of component shortages. Unexpected changes in business conditions, materials pricing,\nincluding inflation of raw material costs, labor issues, wars, trade policies, natural disasters, health epidemics, trade and shipping\ndisruptions, port congestions, cyberattacks and other factors beyond our or our suppliers\u2019 control could also affect these suppliers\u2019\nability to deliver technologies or components to us or to remain solvent and operational. Additionally, if our suppliers do not accurately\nforecast and effectively allocate production or if they are not willing to allocate sufficient production to us, or face other challenges\nsuch as insolvency, it may reduce our access to components and require us to search for new suppliers. The unavailability of any\ncomponent or supplier could result in production delays, idle manufacturing facilities, product design changes and loss of access to\nimportant technology and tools for producing and supporting our products, as well as impact our capacity expansion and our ability to\nfulfill our obligations under customer contracts. Moreover, significant increases in our production or product design changes by us have\nrequired and may in the future require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time. We have faced in the past, and\nmay face suppliers who are unwilling or unable to sustainably meet our timelines or our cost, quality and volume needs, which may\nincrease our costs or require us to replace them with other sources. Finally, as we construct new manufacturing facilities and add\nproduction lines to existing facilities, we may experience issues in correspondingly increasing the level of localized procurement at\nthose facilities. While we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate sources or develop our own replacements for\nmost of our components, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so quickly or at all. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in\nour continuous efforts to negotiate with existing suppliers to obtain cost reductions and avoid unfavorable changes to terms, source less\nexpensive suppliers for certain parts and redesign certain parts to make them less expensive to produce, especially in the case of\nincreases in materials pricing.

Moreover, we will have to establish and ramp production of our\nproprietary battery cells and packs at our new factories, and we additionally intend to incorporate sequential design and manufacturing\nchanges into vehicles manufactured at each new factory. If we experience any issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs,\ncapital efficiency and production capacity for our new factories, expanding and managing teams to implement iterative design and\nproduction changes there, maintaining and complying with the terms of any debt financing that we obtain to fund them or generating\nand maintaining demand for the vehicles we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may\nbe harmed.\nWe may be unable to grow our global product sales, delivery and installation capabilities and our servicing and vehicle\ncharging networks, or we may be unable to accurately project and effectively manage our growth.\nOur success will depend on our ability to continue to expand our sales capabilities. We are targeting a global mass demographic\nwith a broad range of potential customers, in which we have relatively limited experience projecting demand and pricing our products.\nWe currently produce numerous international variants at a limited number of factories, and if our specific demand expectations for\nthese variants prove inaccurate, we may not be able to timely generate deliveries matched to the vehicles that we produce in the same\ntimeframe or that are commensurate with the size of our operations in a given region. Likewise, as we develop and grow our energy\nproducts and services worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to correctly forecast demand in various markets.\nBecause we do not have independent dealer networks, we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicles to our customers. As\nour production volumes continue to grow, we have faced in the past, and may face challenges with deliveries at increasing volumes,\nparticularly in international markets requiring significant transit times. We have also deployed a number of delivery models, such as\ndeliveries to customers\u2019 homes and workplaces and touchless deliveries, but there is no guarantee that such models will be scalable or\nbe accepted globally. Likewise, as we ramp our energy products, we are working to substantially increase our production and\ninstallation capabilities. If we experience production delays or inaccurately forecast demand, our business, financial condition and\noperating results may be harmed.\nMoreover, because of our unique expertise with our vehicles, we recommend that our vehicles be serviced by us or by certain\nauthorized professionals. If we experience delays in adding servicing capacity or servicing our vehicles efficiently, or experience\nunforeseen issues with the reliability of our vehicles, particularly higher-volume additions to our fleet such as Model 3 and Model Y, it\ncould overburden our servicing capabilities and parts inventory. Similarly, the increasing number of Tesla vehicles also requires us to\ncontinue to rapidly increase the number of our Supercharger stations and connectors throughout the world.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to ramp our business to meet our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and vehicle\ncharging targets globally, that our projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate or that the pace of growth or\ncoverage of our customer infrastructure network will meet customer expectations. These plans require significant cash investments and\nmanagement resources and there is no guarantee that they will generate additional sales or installations of our products, or that we will\nbe able to avoid cost overruns or be able to hire additional personnel to support them. As we expand, we will also need to ensure our\ncompliance with regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions applicable to the sale, installation and servicing of our products, the\nsale or dispatch of electricity related to our energy products and the operation of Superchargers.

The prices for these materials fluctuate\nand their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For example, as a\nresult of increased global production of electric vehicles and energy storage products, suppliers of these raw materials may be unable to\nmeet our volume needs. Additionally, our suppliers may not be willing or able to reliably meet our timelines or our cost and quality\nneeds, which may require us to replace them with other sources. Any reduced availability of these materials may impact our access to\ncells and our growth, and any increases in their prices may reduce our profitability if we cannot recoup such costs through increased\nprices. Moreover, our inability to meet demand and any product price increases may harm our brand, growth, prospects and operating\nresults.\nOur future growth and success are dependent upon consumers\u2019 demand for electric vehicles and specifically our vehicles in\nan automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile.\nThough we continue to see increased interest and adoption of electric vehicles, if the market for electric vehicles in general and\nTesla vehicles in particular does not develop as we expect, develops more slowly than we expect, or if demand for our vehicles\ndecreases in our markets or our vehicles compete with each other, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may\nbe harmed.\nIn addition, electric vehicles still constitute a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for our vehicles\ncould be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as:\n\u2022\nperceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance and cost;\n\u2022\nperceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access to\ncharging facilities;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and high fuel-economy\ninternal combustion engine vehicles;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of oil, gasoline and energy;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations and economic incentives and conditions; and\n\u2022\nconcerns about our future viability.\nThe target demographics for our vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry tend to be\ncyclical in many markets, which may expose us to further volatility. We also cannot predict the duration or direction of current global\ntrends or their sustained impact on consumer demand. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible\nand to optimize and evolve our business as appropriate, and attempt to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements\nglobally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources accordingly. Rising interest rates may lead to consumers to\nincreasingly pull back spending, including on our products, which may harm our demand, business and operating results. If we\nexperience unfavorable global market conditions, or if we cannot or do not maintain operations at a scope that is commensurate with\nsuch conditions or are later required to or choose to suspend such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results may be harmed.\nWe face strong competition for our products and services from a growing list of established and new competitors.\nThe worldwide automotive market is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. A\nsignificant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturers, as well as other companies, have entered, or are\nreported to have plans to enter, the market for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully\nelectric vehicles, as well as the market for self-driving technology and other vehicle applications and software platforms.

In addition, decreases in the retail or wholesale\nprices of electricity from utilities or other renewable energy sources could make our products less attractive to customers and lead to an\nincreased rate of customer defaults.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may experience issues with lithium-ion cells or other components manufactured at our Gigafactories, which may harm\nthe production and profitability of our vehicle and energy storage products.\nOur plan to grow the volume and profitability of our vehicles and energy storage products depends on significant lithium-ion\nbattery cell production, including by our partner Panasonic at Gigafactory Nevada. We also produce several vehicle components at our\nGigafactories, such as battery modules and packs and drive units, and manufacture energy storage products. If we are unable to or\notherwise do not maintain and grow our respective operations, or if we are unable to do so cost-effectively or hire and retain highly-\nskilled personnel there, our ability to manufacture our products profitably would be limited, which may harm our business and\noperating results.\nFinally, the high volumes of lithium-ion cells and battery modules and packs manufactured by us and by our suppliers are stored\nand recycled at our various facilities. Any mishandling of these products may cause disruption to the operation of such facilities. While\nwe have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related\nto the cells would not disrupt our operations.

Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., with additional\nmanufacturing operations in China and Europe, create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements\nand charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business\nlocations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our\ncontractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for\ndomestically manufactured products. For example, we monitor tax legislation changes on a global basis, including changes arising as a\nresult of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s multi-jurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and\nprofit shifting. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management\nattention, and may harm our business if we are unable to manage them effectively.\nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected\nto become fully functional.\nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects, whether relating to our software or hardware, that cause them not to\nperform as designed or intended or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD (Supervised)\nfeatures take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to\ndevelop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, allegations\nof product liability, breach of warranty and related consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses.

  "Table of Contents\nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims.\nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in\nthe event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles\nhave been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents\nwhere Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot or FSD (Supervised) features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention,\nespecially in light of NHTSA\u2019s Standing General Order requiring reports regarding certain crashes involving vehicles with advanced\ndriver assistance systems. We have experienced, and we expect to continue to face, claims and regulatory scrutiny arising from or\nrelated to misuse or claimed failures or alleged misrepresentations of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the\nbattery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they\ncontain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have\ndesigned our battery packs to passively contain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be\nno assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a\nhigh-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the\npotential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary\ndamages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative\npublicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability\nclaims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by\ninsurance.\nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts,\ninvestors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence\nmay be challenging due to our limited operating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products;\nany delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing, delivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty\nregarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our quarterly production and sales performance compared\nwith market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control. In particular, Tesla\u2019s products, business,\nresults of operations, and statements and actions of Tesla and its management are subject to significant amounts of commentary by a\nrange of third parties. Such attention can include criticism, which may be exaggerated or unfounded, such as speculation regarding the\nsufficiency or stability of our management team. Any such negative perceptions, whether caused by us or not, may harm our business\nand make it more difficult to raise additional funds if needed.\nWe may be unable to effectively grow, or manage the compliance, residual value, financing and credit risks related to, our\nvarious financing programs.\nWe offer financing arrangements for our vehicles in North America, Europe and Asia primarily ourselves and through various\nfinancial institutions. We also currently offer vehicle financing arrangements directly through our local subsidiaries in certain markets.\nDepending on the country, such arrangements are available for specified models and may include operating leases directly with us\nunder which we typically receive only a very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease, followed by a stream\nof payments over the term of the lease. We have also offered various arrangements for customers of our solar energy systems whereby\nthey pay us a fixed payment to lease or finance the purchase of such systems or purchase electricity generated by them. If we do not\nsuccessfully monitor and comply with applicable national, state and/or local financial regulations and consumer protection laws\ngoverning these transactions, we may become subject to enforcement actions or penalties.\nThe profitability of any directly-leased vehicles returned to us at the end of their leases depends on our ability to accurately",

As of December\u00a031, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the\nrequirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level\nof operations. While we expect to have and grow significant operations at Gigafactory New York and the surrounding Buffalo area, any\nfailure by us in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet all applicable future obligations may result in our\nincurring financial liabilities in the form of \u201cprogram payments\u201d which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our\nfinancial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations. Any of\nthe foregoing events may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel, our ability to compete may be harmed.\nThe loss of the services of any of our key employees or any significant portion of our workforce could disrupt our operations or\ndelay the development, introduction and ramp of our products and services.

Although Mr.\nMusk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.\nFor example: Mr. Musk also currently holds management positions at Space Exploration Technologies Corp., X Corp., X.AI Corp.,\nNeuralink Corp. and The Boring Company, and is involved in other ventures and with the Department of Government Efficiency.\nOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to\ncyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation,\nregulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences.\nWe continue to expand our information technology systems as our operations grow, such as product data management,\nprocurement, inventory management, production planning and execution, sales, service and logistics, dealer management, financial, tax\nand regulatory compliance systems. This includes the implementation of new internally developed systems and the deployment of such\nsystems in the U.S. and abroad. While, we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual\nproperty theft, data breaches, sabotage and other external or internal cyber-attacks or misappropriation, our systems and those of our\nservice providers are potentially vulnerable to malware, ransomware, viruses, denial-of-service attacks, phishing attacks, social\nengineering, computer hacking, unauthorized access, exploitation of bugs, defects and vulnerabilities, breakdowns, damage,\ninterruptions, system malfunctions, power outages, terrorism, acts of vandalism, security breaches, security incidents, inadvertent or\nintentional actions by employees or other third parties, and other cyber-attacks.\nTo the extent any security incident results in unauthorized access or damage to or acquisition, use, corruption, loss, destruction,\nalteration or dissemination of our data, including intellectual property and personal information, or our products or vehicles, or for it to\nbe believed or reported that any of these occurred, it could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with\napplicable data breach notification laws, subject us to time consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigation and\noversight, mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents, or otherwise subject us to liability\nunder laws, regulations and contractual obligations, including those that protect the privacy and security of personal information. This\ncould result in increased costs to us and result in significant legal and financial exposure and/or reputational harm.\nWe also rely on service providers, and similar incidents relating to their information technology systems could also have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks. Our service\nproviders, including our workforce management software provider, have been subject to ransomware and other security incidents, and\nwe cannot guarantee that our or our service providers\u2019 systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects,\nbugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in a security incident, or other disruption to, our or our service providers\u2019 systems. Our ability\nto monitor our service providers\u2019 security measures is limited, and, in any event, malicious third parties may be able to circumvent\nthose security measures.\nFurther, the implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems require significant management time,\nsupport and cost, and there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems as well as\nimplementing new systems and updating current systems, including disruptions to the related areas of business operation. These risks\nmay affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or manufacture, sell, deliver and service products,\nadequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, tax laws and\nother applicable regulations.\nMoreover, if we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted,\nour ability to accurately and/or timely report our financial results could be impaired and deficiencies may arise in our internal control\nover financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results.

  "Table of Contents\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products\u2019 systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\nOur products contain complex information technology systems. For example, our vehicles and energy storage products are\ndesigned with built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates from us to improve or update their functionality.\nWhile we have implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our\nproducts and their systems, malicious entities have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to\nmodify, alter and use such networks, products and systems to gain control of, or to change, our products\u2019 functionality, user interface\nand performance characteristics or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our products. We encourage reporting of potential\nvulnerabilities in the security of our products through our security vulnerability reporting policy, and we aim to remedy any reported\nand verified vulnerability. However, there can be no assurance that any vulnerabilities will not be exploited before they can be\nidentified, or that our remediation efforts are or will be successful.\nAny unauthorized access to or control of our products or their systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims or\ngovernment investigations. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our products, their systems or\ndata, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our products, their systems or data are capable of being hacked, may\nharm our brand, prospects and operating results. We have been the subject of such reports in the past.\nOur business may be adversely affected by any disruptions caused by union activities.\nIt is not uncommon for employees of certain trades at companies such as ours to belong to a union, which can result in higher\nemployee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. Moreover, regulations in some jurisdictions outside of the U.S. mandate\nemployee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreements and work councils with certain consultation rights with respect to\nthe relevant companies\u2019 operations. Although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employees,\nthey may still decide to join or seek recognition to form a labor union, or we may be required to become a union signatory. From time\nto time, labor unions have engaged in campaigns to organize certain of our operations, as part of which such unions have filed unfair\nlabor practice charges against us with the National Labor Relations Board (the \u201cNLRB\u201d), and they may do so in the future. Any\nunfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla\u2019s treatment of our employees.\nFurthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and\nfreight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and\nmay harm our business and operating results.\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles\nhave resulted from various hardware and software-related safety or non-compliance determinations. In addition to recalls initiated by us\nfor various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate\nproduct recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect\ndetermination or have data that contradicts it. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls or field actions if any of\nour products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations,\nsuch as U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or provide certain functionalities. Such recalls or field actions, whether voluntary\nor involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant\nexpense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims.\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell directly to customers.

Warranty reserves include our management\u2019s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items\nunder warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\nSuch estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products that\nwe have introduced relatively recently and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may\ncause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and\nother claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance\ncoverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may\ninclude significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance\ncoverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may\nrequire us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur debt agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe terms of certain of our debt facilities contain, and any of our other future debt agreements may contain, covenant restrictions\nthat may limit our ability to operate our business, including restrictions on our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things,\nincur additional debt or create liens. In addition, under certain circumstances we are required to maintain a certain amount of liquidity.\nAs a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial\ntransactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Furthermore, our failure to comply with our debt\ncovenants could result in a default under our debt agreements, which could permit the holders to accelerate our obligation to repay the\ndebt. If any of our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to repay it.\nAdditional funds may not be available to us when we need or want them.\nOur business and our future plans for expansion are capital-intensive, and the specific timing of cash inflows and outflows may\nfluctuate substantially from period to period. We may need or want to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-\nrelated or debt securities or through obtaining credit from financial institutions to fund, together with our principal sources of liquidity,\nthe costs of developing and manufacturing our current or future products, to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expenses or\nfor new significant strategic investments, or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the\nterms of such indebtedness. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at\nall. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could\nbe materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be negatively impacted by any early obsolescence of our manufacturing equipment.\nWe depreciate the cost of our manufacturing equipment over their expected useful lives. However, product cycles or\nmanufacturing technology may change periodically, and we may decide to update our products or manufacturing processes more\nquickly than expected. Moreover, improvements in engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency may result in our ability to\nmanufacture our products using less of our currently installed equipment. Alternatively, as we ramp and mature the production of our\nproducts to higher levels, we may discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment. The\nuseful life of any equipment that would be retired early as a result would be shortened, causing the depreciation on such equipment to\nbe accelerated, and our results of operations may be harmed.\nThere is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness or that we will not\nincur additional indebtedness.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness",

  "Table of Contents\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, or to refinance our\nindebtedness as we may need or desire, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and\nother factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy\nour obligations under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur, and to make necessary capital expenditures.\nIf we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying\ninvestments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or\nhighly dilutive. Our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at\nsuch time. In addition, our ability to make payments may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our\nfuture indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in these activities on desirable terms or at all, which may result in a default on our\nexisting or future indebtedness and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies and have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue,\noperating expenses and localized subsidiary debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent we have significant\nrevenues denominated in such foreign currencies, any strengthening of the U.S. dollar would tend to reduce our revenues as measured\nin U.S. dollars, as we have historically experienced, and are currently experiencing. We have also experienced, and will continue to\nexperience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash\nequivalents balances). In addition, a portion of our costs and expenses have been, and we anticipate will continue to be, denominated in\nforeign currencies. If we do not have fully offsetting revenues in these currencies and if the value of the U.S. dollar depreciates\nsignificantly against these currencies, our costs as measured in U.S. dollars as a percent of our revenues will correspondingly increase\nand our margins will suffer.

From time to time, the holders of such intellectual property rights may assert their rights and\nurge us to take licenses and/or may bring suits alleging infringement or misappropriation of such rights, which could result in\nsubstantial costs, negative publicity and management attention, regardless of merit.\nIn addition, the effective protection for our brands, technologies, and proprietary information may be limited or unavailable in\ncertain countries, making it difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. Although we make\nreasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, we cannot guarantee that these actions will deter or\nprevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and confidential\ninformation could affect our competitive position.\nWhile we endeavor to obtain and protect the intellectual property rights that we expect will allow us to retain or advance our\nstrategic initiatives in these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately identify and protect the portions\nof intellectual property that are strategic to our business, or mitigate the risk of potential suits or other legal demands by third parties.\nAccordingly, we may consider the entering into licensing agreements with respect to such rights, although no assurance can be given\nthat such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur, and such licenses and associated litigation could\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses.

For\nexample, previously available incentives favoring electric vehicles in certain areas have expired or were cancelled or temporarily\nunavailable, and in some cases were not eventually replaced or reinstituted, which may have negatively impacted sales. In addition,\ncertain government and economic incentives may also be implemented or amended to provide benefits to manufacturers who assemble\ndomestically, have local suppliers or have other characteristics that may not apply to Tesla. Such developments could negatively impact\ndemand for our vehicles, and we and our customers may have to adjust to them, including through pricing modifications.\nIn addition, certain governmental rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives that are currently available with respect to\nour solar and energy storage product businesses allow us to lower our costs and encourage customers to buy our products and investors\nto invest in our solar financing funds. However, these incentives may expire when the allocated funding is exhausted, reduced or\nterminated as renewable energy adoption rates increase, sometimes without warning. Likewise, in jurisdictions where net metering is\ncurrently available, our customers receive bill credits from utilities for energy that their solar energy systems generate and export to the\ngrid in excess of the electric load they use. The benefit available under net metering has been or has been proposed to be reduced,\naltered or eliminated in several jurisdictions, and has also been contested and may continue to be contested before the Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission. Any reductions or terminations of such incentives may harm our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results by making our products less competitive for customers, increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our\nability to attract investment partners and to form new financing funds for our solar and energy storage assets.\nFinally, we and our fund investors claim these U.S. federal tax credits and certain state incentives in amounts based on\nindependently appraised fair market values of our solar and energy storage systems.

New, or\nchanges in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules could also lead to increased costs of compliance, including\nremediations of any discovered issues, and changes to our operations, which may be significant, and any failures to comply could result\nin significant expenses, delays or fines. In addition, as we have increased our operations, we are and may continue to be subject to\nincreased scrutiny, including litigation and government investigations, that we will need to defend against. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully defend ourselves in such litigation or government investigations, it may harm our brand, ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees, business and financial condition. We are also subject to laws and regulations applicable to the supply,\nmanufacture, import, sale, service and performance of our products both domestically and abroad. For example, in countries outside of\nthe U.S., we are required to meet standards relating to vehicle safety, fuel economy and emissions that are often materially different\nfrom equivalent requirements in the U.S., thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicles and systems to ensure regulatory\ncompliance in all countries. This process may include official review and certification of our vehicles by foreign regulatory agencies\nprior to market entry, as well as compliance with foreign reporting and recall management systems requirements.\nIn particular, we offer in our vehicles in certain markets Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) features that today assist drivers with\ncertain tedious and potentially dangerous aspects of road travel, but which currently require drivers to remain fully engaged in the\ndriving operation. We are continuing to develop our Autopilot and FSD (Supervised) technology. There are a variety of international,\nfederal and state regulations that may apply to, and may adversely affect, the design and performance, sale, marketing, registration and\noperation of Autopilot and FSD (Supervised), and future capability, including autonomous vehicles that may not be operated by a\nhuman driver. This includes many existing vehicle standards that were not originally intended to apply to vehicles that may not be\noperated by a human driver. Such regulations, including their enforcement or the enforcement policy associated with the regulations,\ncontinue to rapidly change, which increases the likelihood of a patchwork of complex or conflicting regulations, or may delay, restrict\nor prohibit the availability of certain functionalities and vehicle designs, which could adversely affect our business.\nFinally, as a manufacturer, installer and service provider with respect to solar generation and energy storage systems, a supplier\nof electricity generated and stored by certain of the solar energy and energy storage systems we install for customers, and a provider of\ngrid services through virtual power plant models, we are impacted by federal, state and local regulations and policies concerning the\nimport or export of components, electricity pricing, the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the\nelectrical grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party-owned systems. If regulations and policies are introduced that\nadversely impact the import or export of components, or the interconnection, maintenance or use of our solar and energy storage\nsystems, they could deter potential customers from purchasing our solar and energy storage products and services, threaten the\neconomics of our existing contracts and cause us to cease solar and energy storage system sales and services in the relevant\njurisdictions, which may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny failure by us to comply with a variety of U.S. and international privacy and consumer protection laws may harm us.\nAny failure by us or our vendors or other business partners to comply with our public privacy notice or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy, data protection, artificial intelligence or security laws or regulations relating to the processing, collection, use,\nretention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information could result in regulatory or litigation-related actions against us,\nlegal liability, fines, damages, ongoing audit requirements and other significant costs. Substantial expenses and operational changes\nmay be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such laws, and even an unsuccessful challenge by customers or\nregulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us.

For example, the General\nData Protection Regulation applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the European Union\nrequiring certain data protection measures when handling, with a significant risk of fines for noncompliance. Similarly, our North\nAmerican operations are subject to complex and changing federal and US state-specific data privacy laws and regulations, such as the\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act which imposes certain legal obligations on our use and processing of personal information related to\nCalifornia residents. Finally, additional privacy and cybersecurity laws have come into effect in China, and other jurisdictions where\nTesla has a market presence.\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs and make enhancements to relevant data practices.

  "Table of Contents\nIn addition to the risks related to general privacy regulation, we may also be subject to specific vehicle manufacturer obligations\nrelating to cybersecurity, data privacy and data localization requirements which place additional risks to our international operations.\nRisks and penalties could include ongoing audit requirements, data protection authority investigations, legal proceedings by\ninternational governmental entities or others resulting in mandated disclosure of sensitive data or other commercially unfavorable\nterms. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect the security and integrity of our customers\u2019 personal information, we may be required to\nexpend significant resources to comply with data breach requirements if, for example, third parties improperly obtain and use the\npersonal information of our customers or we otherwise experience a data loss with respect to the personal information we process and\nhandle. A major breach of our network security and systems may occur despite defensive measures, and may result in fines, penalties\nand damages and harm our brand, prospects and operating results.\nWe could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions and adverse consequences arising out of certain\ngovernmental investigations and proceedings.\nWe are cooperating with certain government investigations as discussed in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, to the\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To our knowledge, no government agency\nin any such ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. However, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of\nany such ongoing matters, and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability, penalties and other restrictive sanctions\nand adverse consequences if the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in\nthe future. Moreover, we expect to incur costs in responding to related requests for information and subpoenas, and if instituted, in\ndefending against any governmental proceedings.\nWe may face regulatory challenges to or limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly.\nWhile we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sales strategies, including sales through our website, we may not be\nable to sell our vehicles through our own stores in certain states in the U.S. with laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on\nthis direct-to-consumer sales model. It has also been asserted that the laws in some states limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from\nstate motor vehicle regulators, and such assertions persist. In certain locations, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles\nhave been, and may be, challenged by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor\nvehicle industry laws. We have prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results have reinforced our continuing belief that state\nfranchise laws were not intended to apply to a manufacturer that does not have franchise dealers anywhere in the world. In some states,\nthere have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by dealer associations to propose laws that, if enacted, would prevent us from\nobtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to\noperate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. The application of state\nlaws applicable to our operations continues to be difficult to predict.\nInternationally, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have\nentered that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can\nbe complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time. Continued regulatory limitations and other obstacles interfering with our\nability to sell vehicles directly to consumers may harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response\nto various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our common stock has experienced over the last 52 weeks an intra-day\ntrading high of $488.54 per share and a low of $138.80 per share.

While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future\nstockholder litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other\nfactors.\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the\npace at which we continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our\ncurrent manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues\nfrom period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and\nintroduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially\nin the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance.\nMoreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be\nfocused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially, either\nsuddenly or over time.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock\nprice to decline.\nWe provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key\nfactors affecting business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not\nultimately be accurate and has in the past been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps.\nOur guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are\nnot linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance\nvaries from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on our financial performance that could occur as\na result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIf Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan\nobligations, or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was\nused to purchase shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-\nparty participants in such offerings and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a\nportion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr. Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr.\nMusk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he\ncould not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk\nfrom time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to sell shares of our\ncommon stock in satisfaction of such commitments.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and certain of our debt facilities could\nimpair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or\nprevention of an acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 21.606 of the Texas Business Organizations Code\nand other provisions of Texas law that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In\naddition, a change in control may cause the acceleration of certain of our debt facilities.

  "ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as\nsuch term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property\ntheft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity\nrisks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted\napproach including third party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect\nand respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and\napplications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security\ncontrols, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging\nlaws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate\nchanges.\nWe have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected\nstages: 1) preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and\nrecovery, and 4) post-incident analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product\nSecurity, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.\nSecurity events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are\nevaluated to determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.\nWe also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals\nthen collaborate with technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form\ndetection, mitigation and remediation strategies.\nAs part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity\nprograms and compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been\ncertified to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.\nOur risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and\nmitigate risks from third parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service\nproviders. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers\nand potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor\nonboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us\nfrom third-party incidents.\nWe describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations,\nor financial condition, under the heading \u201cOur information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers\nor users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft,\nclaims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability, reputational damage and other adverse consequences\u201d included as part\nof our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCybersecurity Governance\nCybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our\nAudit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. Members of the Audit Committee receive updates\non a quarterly basis from senior management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and\nLegal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity.

We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-\nperformance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,\ninstallation, operation, charging, insurance, financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly\nfocused on products and services based on AI, robotics and automation.\nIn 2024, we produced approximately 1,773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,789,000 consumer vehicles.\nWe are focused on profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more\naffordable products, further improving and deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities\nthrough our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery\ncapabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically integrating and localizing our supply chain, and\nexpanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.\nIn 2024, we deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the\nmarket penetration of our energy storage products.\nIn 2024, we recognized total revenues of $97.69 billion, representing an increase of $917 million compared to the prior year. In\n2024, our net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.09 billion, representing a decrease of $7.91 billion compared to the\nprior year, primarily due to the impact of releasing $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and state\ndeferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.We continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity,\nexpand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and\ndeployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI, software, and fleet-based profits for further\nrevenue growth.\nWe ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $7.47 billion from\nthe end of 2023. Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $14.92 billion in 2024 compared to $13.26 billion in 2023,\nrepresenting an increase of $1.67 billion. Capital expenditures amounted to $11.34 billion in 2024 compared to $8.90 billion in 2023,\nrepresenting an increase of $2.44 billion.

  "Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook\nAutomotive\u2014Production\nThe following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under\ndevelopment, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nRegion\nVehicle Model(s)\nProduction Status\nCalifornia\nModel S / Model X\nActive\n\u00a0\nModel 3 / Model Y\nActive\nShanghai\nModel 3 / Model Y\nActive\nBerlin\nModel Y\nActive\nTexas\nModel Y\nActive\n\u00a0\nCybertruck\nActive\nCybercab\nIn development\nNevada\nTesla Semi\nPilot production\nTBD\nRoadster\nIn development\nWe are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models such\nas our Cybertruck, Tesla Semi and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, and ramping the production at our\nGigafactories to their installed production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The\nnext phase of production growth will depend on the continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the\nintroduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available\nsources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and\nproduction costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease production costs and increase affordability\nand customer awareness.\nThese plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be\nexacerbated by new product and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any\nindustry-wide component constraints, labor shortages and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during\nthe first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production volumes partially caused by the early phase of the\nproduction ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg resulting\nfrom shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. In the first quarter of 2025, as we launch our New Model\nY worldwide, we may similarly experience delays or declines in production volumes due to simultaneous manufacturing ramps in\nfacilities on three continents. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for\niterative manufacturing and design improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\nAutomotive\u2014Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure\nOur cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our\nvehicles\u2019 affordability and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving\nour vehicles\u2019 performance and functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as\nAutopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated\nModel 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our\nvehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.\n33\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n55/157",
  "However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty,\nincluding with respect to trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices,\ninterest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets\nin which we operate, central banks in developed countries raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the\naffordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in\nmany markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations. Moreover, as additional\ncompetitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to\nexecute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers\u2019 liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current\nchallenges in the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes\nto cost. These macroeconomic and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate\nfor our vehicles, and in turn our operating margin. Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact\nour production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and\nwe believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower\nlogistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our competitors, while our new products will\nhelp enable future growth.\nAs our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become\na bottleneck on our total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each\nquarter, which will help to reduce the cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to\ncontinue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and\noptimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive\nmanufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (\u201cNACS\u201d) and agreements with us to utilize\nour Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer demands.\nWe also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production\nand capabilities of our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the introduction of Powerwall 3 in 2024, and\nthe ramps of our Megafactories in Shanghai and Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary\nmeaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we\nwill have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage products. At the same time, changes in government and\neconomic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape.\nCash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends\nOur capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core\nprojects at any given time, and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously\ndeveloping and ramping new products, building or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and\nmanufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial\nintelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may vary depending on overall priority among projects,\nthe pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products, increased capital efficiencies and the\naddition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other\ncontinuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $11.00 billion\nin 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and",

Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under development, all other\ncontinuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $11.00 billion\nin 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.\nOur business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and\nwith better working capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is\nalso generally facilitating positive cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest\nin autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same\ntime, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-\nintensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting\nfrom changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be self-funding to continue as long as\nmacroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.\n34\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n56/157",
  "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical\nexperience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the\naccounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the\nestimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are\nmaterial differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows may be affected.\nThe estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements,\nsales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory\nvaluation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of\noperating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware\nof any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying\nvalue of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new\nevents occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different\nassumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nAutomotive Sales\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features\nand services that meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from\nContracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet\nconnectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery\nto the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in\naccordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the\ncontractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future\nmarket values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our\ninternet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle\nand recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other\nlimited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue\nrelated to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.\nRevenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing\nmaintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by\nconsidering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be\navailable.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete\ninventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future\ndemand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale\nof the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory\non-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and\nsubsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.",

Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and\nsubsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be\nrequired. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n57/157",

  "Warranties\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the\nenergy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the\nproducts sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if\nidentified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future\nclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material\nchanges to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our\nvehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these\nwarranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is\nincluded within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for\nthe contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for\nthe current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of\nrevenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance\nis primarily related to our automotive segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) granted to employees and\nfor our employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based\nawards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering\ndate using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free\ninterest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair\nvalue of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is\nrecognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting\nperiod, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement\nperiod of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of\nour stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation\nexpense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our\nprovision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax\nassets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all\nrelevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our\nhistory of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis,\nvolatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of\nreversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business\noperations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our common\nstock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and",

  "Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many\ntransactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty\non our tax attributes or taxes payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our\nbelief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be\nfully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions,\nwhich requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by\nthe various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our\nconsideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and\ninterpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax\naudit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from\nour expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues\n\u00a0\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023 Change\n2023 vs. 2022 Change\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nAutomotive sales\n$\n72,480\u00a0\n$\n78,509\u00a0\n$\n67,210\u00a0\n$\n(6,029)\n(8)%\n$\n11,299\u00a0\n17\u00a0%\nAutomotive regulatory credits\n2,763\u00a0\n1,790\u00a0\n1,776\u00a0\n973\u00a0\n54\u00a0%\n14\u00a0\n1\u00a0%\nAutomotive leasing\n1,827\u00a0\n2,120\u00a0\n2,476\u00a0\n(293)\n(14)%\n(356)\n(14)%\nTotal automotive revenues\n77,070\u00a0\n82,419\u00a0\n71,462\u00a0\n(5,349)\n(6)%\n10,957\u00a0\n15\u00a0%\nServices and other\n10,534\u00a0\n8,319\u00a0\n6,091\u00a0\n2,215\u00a0\n27\u00a0%\n2,228\u00a0\n37\u00a0%\nTotal automotive & services and other\nsegment revenue\n87,604\u00a0\n90,738\u00a0\n77,553\u00a0\n(3,134)\n(3)%\n13,185\u00a0\n17\u00a0%\nEnergy generation and storage segment revenue\n10,086\u00a0\n6,035\u00a0\n3,909\u00a0\n4,051\u00a0\n67\u00a0%\n2,126\u00a0\n54\u00a0%\nTotal revenues\n$\n97,690\u00a0\n$\n96,773\u00a0\n$\n81,462\u00a0\n$\n917\u00a0\n1\u00a0%\n$\n15,311\u00a0\n19\u00a0%\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our\nFSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software\nupdates.

These changes are primarily due to the impact of releasing the valuation\nallowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In the\nfourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in\nrecent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more\nlikely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released $6.54 billion of our\nvaluation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we continue to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are\nrealizable, except for our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses.\nSee Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nfurther details.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to\nfund ongoing operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our\nproprietary battery cells, additional manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and\nthe continued expansion of our retail and service locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support\nNACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled products.\nIn addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be\nable to adjust our capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations\ndecrease in scale or ramp more slowly than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to\ncorrespondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures. Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to\nraise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through drawdowns on\nexisting or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time determine that it is in our best interests to\nvoluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n67/157",

In general, we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries.\nAccordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign\ncurrency risk.\nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the\nsettlement and the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency\n(primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances).\nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term.

Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for digital\nassets in 2024.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management\u2019s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the\nCompany\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\nbasis for our opinions.\n46\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n74/157",
  "Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding\nprevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements\nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive\nsegment, was $6,716 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company provides a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used Tesla\nvehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for these products sold, which includes management\u2019s best estimate of the projected costs to\nrepair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an\nestimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle\nmodels; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management\u2019s\nsignificant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models; and, (iii) the audit\neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion\non the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management\u2019s\nestimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management\u2019s significant\nassumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims\nincurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims\nprocessed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation of future claims and (ii) the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimate\nby (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and (b) comparing the\nindependent estimate to management\u2019s estimate. Developing the independent estimate involved evaluating the appropriateness of\ncertain aspects of management\u2019s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2025\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005.\n47\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231",

  "Tesla, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 \u2013 Overview\nTesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d, the \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003 and\nconverted to a Texas corporation on June 13, 2024. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric\nvehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our products.\nNote 2 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and\noperations and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC\n810, Consolidation (\u201cASC 810\u201d), we consolidate any variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have\nformed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of\ncertain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a\ncontrolling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial\ninterest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810\nrequires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant\nto the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in\nwhich we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the\nprimary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the\nVIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have\nbeen eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The\nestimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return\nreserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation,\nwarranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease\nvehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific\nevents or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets\nor liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and\nadditional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or\nconditions.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial\nstatements and the accompanying notes.\n53\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n85/157",

We recognize\nrevenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically\nreceived at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for\nwhich payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience\nplus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features\nand services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned\nupon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such\nservices to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is\nearlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected\nownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the\ncustomer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate\nstandalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other\ninformation that may be available.\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer\u2019s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset\nagainst automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs\nrelated to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts\nbilled to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the\ncost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of\nautomotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nWe offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under\nthese programs, we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our\ncommercial banking partner, with the transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.\n54\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n86/157",
  "We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a\nguarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual or determined residual value at the\nend of the lease term. We estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on\nour consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to\ndetermine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data\nrelated to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The\ntotal recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023. Our\nmaximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle\u2019s contractual residual\nvalue at the end of the lease term was $1.45 billion and $166 million as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred revenue related to the access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity,\nfree Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDeferred revenue \u2014 beginning of period\n$\n3,536\u00a0 $\n2,913\u00a0\nAdditions\n1,343\u00a0\n1,201\u00a0\nNet changes in liability for pre-existing contracts,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0including foreign exchange impact\n(92)\n17\u00a0\nRevenue recognized\n(1,188)\n(595)\nDeferred revenue \u2014 end of period\n$\n3,599\u00a0 $\n3,536\u00a0\nDeferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or\npartially unsatisfied, as of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December\u00a031, 2023 and\n2022 was $872 million and $469 million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue\nbalance as of December\u00a031, 2024, we expect to recognize $840 million of revenue in the next 12 months.

We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards\nand other regulatory requirements.\nPayments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance\nwith payment terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have\nnegligible incremental costs associated with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party.\nDeferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was immaterial as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023.

  "Automotive Leasing Revenue\nDirect Vehicle Operating Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in\nEurope. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term,\ncustomers may opt to return the vehicles to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing\ntransactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual\nterm, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of\nDecember\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which\nwill be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\nDirect Sales-Type Leasing Program\nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under\nASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up\nto 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive\nleasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease\nis recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December\u00a031,\n2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7\nmillion, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.\nServices and Other Revenue\nServices and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid\nSupercharging, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.\nRevenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and\nextended service plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready\nobligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use\nstandalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other\nperformance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are typically received at the point\nwhen control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid\nplans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued liabilities and other on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from customers\nand unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred\nrevenue excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to\nresidential, small commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-\nscale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial\ncustomers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is\nrecognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the\nauthority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of the\ninstallation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been\ndelivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon\ninvoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\n56\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n88/157",
  "For certain large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and\ninstallation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue\nfrom such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total\nestimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various\nobligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on\nestimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions\npaid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are\ntypically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.\nAs part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that\nthe underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy\nstorage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of\nvariable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer\npayments that will be made based on our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments\nrepresent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of\neach reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the transaction price only to the\nextent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nWe record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is\nrecognized as revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue\nrelated to such customer payments amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms.\nRevenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and $571 million for the\nyears ended December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the\ntransaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected\ncontract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the\nvalue of the performance to date. As of December\u00a031, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were\nunsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $7.18 billion. Of this\namount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.\nWe have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, in Accounts\nreceivable, net, and $658\u00a0million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Leasing\nFor revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products,\nwe record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a\nstraight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between\nthe payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFor solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have\ndetermined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized\nbased on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are\nmet.\nWe record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of\nrevenue recognized, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term.

Cost of\nautomotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory\nwhen it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.\nAdditionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting to $625\u00a0million and $359\u00a0million\nfor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAutomotive Leasing\nCost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with\ndirect sales-type leases and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.\nServices and Other\nCosts of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing\nnon-warranty after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide\nvehicle insurance and costs of retail merchandise sales.\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\nEnergy Generation and Storage\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead,\nincluding depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and\nstorage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable\nvalue and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is\nprimarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and\namortization of any initial direct costs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and\nliability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement\nand tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable\nincome.

  "Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any\nvaluation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the\nrealizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of\nrealizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for\npermanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based\ncompensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our\nassessment of the Company\u2019s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to\nhistorical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions\nimpacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future\ntaxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available\ninformation.\nWe record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we\nbelieve that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by certain\nforeign subsidiaries. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a\ncurrent period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which\nwe recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss)\nconsists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from\nthe determination of net income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure\nthe cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service\nand/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-\nScholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are\nsubjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair\nmarket value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide\nservice in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months\nfor the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.\nFor performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement\nperiod of individual performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.\nAs we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our\ncommon stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of\nour stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation\nexpense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n59\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n91/157",
  "Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain\nfunding arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating\nleases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have\nfurther determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances\nthat reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value\n(\u201cHLBV\u201d) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the\nnet assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as\nnoncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts\nreported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the\nthird parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net\nassets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the\nbalance sheet date and distributed to the third parties. The third parties\u2019 interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined\nas the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets\nbetween the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third\nparties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable\nnoncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these\nthird parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.\nNet Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders\nBasic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income\nattributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period.

The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering\nvarious financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other\nautomotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts\nreceivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed\nuncollectible.\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we\nare waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing\npartners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts\nreceivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated\nfor each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual\npayment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing\ntimelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable\nbalance from period to period.

Financing receivables are carried at\namortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain\nthe allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining\nexpected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term\nas revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information\n(e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant\u2019s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on\npayment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong\ncreditworthiness at loan origination.\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all\nfinancing receivables, we define \u201cpast due\u201d as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the\ncontractual due date. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an\nimmaterial balance being past due.

  "Concentration of Risk\nCredit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments,\nrestricted cash, accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high\ncredit quality financial institutions or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of\ninsured limits. As of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, no entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary\ncomponents of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently\nmanage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and\noperating results.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy\nproducts, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete\ninventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future\ndemand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale\nof the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory\non-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and\nsubsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be\nrequired. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\nOperating Lease Vehicles\nVehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less\naccumulated depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive\nleasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was $7.03\nbillion and $7.36 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated\ndepreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDigital Assets, Net\nWe account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-\n60, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-\nparty custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated\nbalance sheet at fair value. Periods prior to January 1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their\nacquisition.\nWe determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d),\nbased on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We\ndetermine the cost basis of our digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received. Realized and unrealized gains and\nlosses are now recorded to Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.\n63\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n97/157",
  "For periods prior to January 1, 2024, impairment losses were recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated\nstatements of operations in the period in which the impairment was identified. Also for periods prior to January 1, 2024, gains were not\nrecorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they were presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held\nwithin Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price\nand carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.\nSee Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.\nSolar Energy Systems, Net\nWe are the lessor of solar energy systems, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of solar energy\nsystems is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 35 years. The gross cost of solar energy\nsystems as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023 was $6.79 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively. Solar energy systems on the consolidated\nbalance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.86 billion and $1.64 billion as of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:\nMachinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture\n3 to 15 years\nTooling\n4 to 7 years\nBuilding and building improvements\n15 to 30 years\nComputer equipment and software\n3 to 6 years\nAI infrastructure\n5 to 30 years\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. AI infrastructure includes our\nowned data centers.\nUpon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed\nfrom the consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance\nand repair expenditures are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an\nasset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We\nmeasure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate.\nIf the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024,\n2023 and 2022, we have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from\nseven to thirty years.\nGoodwill\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that it might be impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit\u2019s fair value. For the years ended December\u00a031,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not recognize any impairment of goodwill.\n64\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n98/157",
  "Capitalization of Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property,\nplant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation\nactivities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five\nyears.\nSoftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent\nto the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are\nexpected to become significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made\ngenerally available to our customers.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we\nhave recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.\nForeign Currency\nWe determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based\non the primary currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative\ntranslation adjustment created by the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each\nsubsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency\nrate to translate the balance sheet.\nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in\ncurrencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income\n(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a net\nforeign currency transaction gain of $57 million, gain of $122 million and loss of $89 million, respectively.\nWarranties\nWe provide a manufacturer\u2019s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the\nenergy generation and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the\nproducts sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if\nidentified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future\nclaims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material\nchanges to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our\nvehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these\nwarranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is\nincluded within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for\nthe contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for\nthe current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of\nrevenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance\nis primarily related to our automotive segment.

  "Customer Deposits\nCustomer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation\nfor a vehicle or an energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer\ndeposits also include prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans.\nCustomer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied\ntowards the customer\u2019s purchase balance.\nGovernment Assistance Programs and Incentives\nGlobally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements.\nGovernment incentives are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of\nexpense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have\nbeen met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.\nThe IRA Incentives\nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The\nIRA includes multiple incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in\naddition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater\nthan $1\u00a0billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended\nDecember\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our costs of revenue in our consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nGigafactory New York\u2014New York State Investment and Lease\nWe have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the\nlease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are\nrequired to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the\nSUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and\ncommissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such\namount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility within the\nEnergy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations and was\nnot material for any period presented.\nGigafactory Shanghai\u2014Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits\nWe have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of\nthe arrangement, we are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of\n2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in\nconnection with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). Incentives\nthat offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and\nequipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our manufacturing operations are recorded as an\noffset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.

The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity\u2019s\neffective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for\nannual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet\nbeen issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our\nconsolidated financial statements, once adopted.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The\nASU requires the disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation,\ndepreciation, and amortization, within relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of\nselling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15,\n2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied\nprospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of this ASU or retrospectively to\nany or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be\ndetermined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value\nhierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as\nquoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or\nindirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data.

  "Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets\nof our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or\ndeferred issuance costs. As of December\u00a031, 2024, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.\n2024 Notes\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the 2024 Notes reached maturity and were fully settled. Additionally, in 2024, we fully\nsettled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 11.4 million shares of\nour common stock.\nCredit Agreement\nIn January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRCF Credit Agreement\u201d) with a\nsyndicate of banks. The RCF Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00\nbillion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general\ncorporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a)\nTerm SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated\nin pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted\nEURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating\nassigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the \u201cCredit Rating\u201d) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is\nvariable based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes\nFrom time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into\nspecial purpose entities (\u201cSPEs\u201d) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs\nare consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and\ninterest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs\u2019 expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the\nowners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our\nrevenue recognition policy. The SPEs\u2019 assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs,\nincluding the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\nIn 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and/or financing receivables into SPEs and issued\n$2.45\u00a0billion in aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued\nAutomotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $2.44\u00a0billion.\nEnergy Asset-backed Notes\nIn 2024, we transferred certain financing receivables into an SPE and issued $499 million in aggregate principal amount of\nEnergy Asset-backed Notes, backed by these financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $494\nmillion. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these financing\nreceivables are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE\u2019s expenses,\nand any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPE\u2019s assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of\nthe SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed Notes holders, have no recourse to our other assets.\nCash Equity Debt\nIn connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal\namount of debt that bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and\nis non-recourse to our other assets.\n74\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n111/157",
  "China Working Capital Facility\nIn April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the \u201cChina Working Capital Facility\u201d) with lenders in\nChina for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 20.00\u00a0billion to be used for certain production expenditures as well as\nrepayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed funds bear interest at a rate equal to the Loan Prime Rate published by the People\u2019s\nBank of China minus 1.18%. The China Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to our assets.\nPledged Assets\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $5.16 billion and $4.64 billion of our assets (consisting\nprincipally of operating lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our\noutstanding debt.\nSchedule of Principal Maturities of Debt\nThe future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December\u00a031, 2024 were as follows (in millions):\nRecourse debt\nNon-recourse debt\nTotal\n2025\n$\n4\u00a0 $\n2,349\u00a0 $\n2,353\u00a0\n2026\n\u2014\u00a0\n4,116\u00a0\n4,116\u00a0\n2027\n\u2014\u00a0\n699\u00a0\n699\u00a0\n2028\n\u2014\u00a0\n243\u00a0\n243\u00a0\n2029\n\u2014\u00a0\n95\u00a0\n95\u00a0\nThereafter\n3\u00a0\n398\u00a0\n401\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n7\u00a0 $\n7,900\u00a0 $\n7,907\u00a0\nNote 11 \u2013 Leases\nWe have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse\nfacilities, retail and service locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an\narrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement,\nwhich is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account\nfor lease and non-lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the\nexception of direct sales-type leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the\ntiming and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if\naccounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease.\nWe have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12\nmonths or less at lease inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All\nother lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at\ncommencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate\nbased on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nOur leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also\ninclude options to terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease\nterms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\n75\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n112/157",
  "Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating\nexpenses depending on the nature of the leased asset.

The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options\nare as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.92\u00a0%\n3.90\u00a0%\n3.11\u00a0%\nExpected term (in years)\n4.3\n4.5\n4.1\nExpected volatility\n59\u00a0%\n63\u00a0%\n63\u00a0%\nDividend yield\n0.0\u00a0%\n0.0\u00a0%\n0.0\u00a0%\nGrant date fair value per share\n$\n114.29\u00a0\n$\n121.62\u00a0\n$\n114.51\u00a0\nThe fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing\nfair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury\nnotes with maturities approximating each grant\u2019s expected life.

  "As of December\u00a031, 2024, we maintained valuation allowances of $1.22\u00a0billion for deferred tax assets that are not more likely\nthan not to be realized, which primarily included our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign\noperating losses. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended December\u00a031,\n2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nvaluation allowance increase during the year ended December\u00a031, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax\nassets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended\nDecember\u00a031, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state\ndeferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount\nof our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we\nconcluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released the\nvaluation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was\nprimarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance are more\nlikely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in the respective jurisdictions.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we had $4.34 billion of federal and $8.59 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available\nto offset future taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for\nstate purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-\nforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no\nsignificant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership\nchanges or expirations.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.48 billion, federal renewable energy tax\ncredits of $1.01 billion, and state research and development tax credits of $1.06 billion. Most of our state research and development tax\ncredits were in the state of California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2035.\nHowever, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no\nor minimal tax costs. We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the\nearnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded.

  "Legal Proceedings\nLitigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award\nOn June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery\nagainst Elon Musk and the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and\nthat such board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in\n2018 (the \u201c2018 CEO Performance Award\u201d). Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion\nfinding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900\nTesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla\u2019s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72%\nof the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO\nPerformance Award. Because Tesla\u2019s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the\nother director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024,\nthe Court issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court\u2019s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in\nthe amount of $345\u00a0million. A final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to\nthe Delaware Supreme Court.\nLitigation Related to Directors\u2019 Compensation\nOn June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on\nbehalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla\u2019s directors, other\nthan Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.\nOn July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an\nadmission of any wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to\nstockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took\nthe settlement and plaintiff counsels\u2019 fee request under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded\nPlaintiff\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of approximately $176\u00a0million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025.\nTesla intends to appeal the Court\u2019s fee award on or before the appeal deadline of February 12, 2025. The settlement is not expected to\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nLitigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction\nBetween August 10, 2018 and September\u00a06, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon\nMusk in connection with Mr. Musk\u2019s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019,\nPlaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as\ndefendants the members of Tesla\u2019s board of directors. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities\nlaws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court\ngranted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of the\ndefendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the\nCourt denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023.

  "On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging,\namong other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company\u2019s 2018\nsettlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company\u2019s corporate governance and\ninternal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees. The lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of a motion to\nconsolidate certain derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced below.\nOn November\u00a015, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging\nbreach of a stock warrant agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. Tesla denied any wrongdoing\nand filed multiple counterclaims. On November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle their claims.\nCertain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware\nBefore converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by\npurported Tesla stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on\nbehalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and\nx.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and\nother relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court\nconsolidated two of the three cases.\nLitigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment\nOn February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (\u201cCRD,\u201d formerly \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in\nAlameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims,\namong others. CRD\u2019s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is\nscheduled for September 15, 2025.\nAdditionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued a cause finding against Tesla\nthat closely parallels the CRD\u2019s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among\nother things, monetary and injunctive relief.\nOn June\u00a016, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of\nTexas, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla\u2019s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of\nfiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination\nand sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and\nattorneys\u2019 fees. On July\u00a022, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated\ncomplaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed\nthe action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint\npurportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint,\nwhich the Court granted on April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024, plaintiffs filed a second amended\nconsolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk.

  "Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services\nWe are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class\nactions and other consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and\nservices. For example, on September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various claims about the Company\u2019s driver assistance technology\nsystems under state and federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated\nAmended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or\nleased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class action complaint was filed in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same defendants. On\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to\namend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to file an amended\ncomplaint and entered judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit, and the parties are briefing the matter. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of\nCalifornia consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving\nCapability\u201d (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and\n(3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms Autopilot and FSD\nCapability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled\nfour of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31,\n2023, the remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss,\nand on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla\u2019s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action\nwas filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court\nand on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\nof California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case\npending arbitration.\nOn February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against\nTesla, Inc., Elon Musk and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material\nmisrepresentations and omissions about the Company\u2019s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and\nother relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint\nwas filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss\nthe amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26,\n2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla\u2019s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nOn March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia. Several similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These\ncomplaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and\nseeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March\n2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court\ngranted Tesla\u2019s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla\u2019s motion to\ndismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla moved\nto dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court\u2019s arbitration order, which was denied.

  "Certain Investigations and Other Matters\nWe regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(\u201cSEC\u201d), the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for\ninformation include topics such as operations, technology (e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability),\ncompliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla\u2019s business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely\ncooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our knowledge no government\nagency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any\nongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse\nimpact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\nWe are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities.\nFor example, during the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including,\npurportedly non-public Tesla business and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals\n(current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On\nAugust 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly\non behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that each assert claims under\nvarious state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other\npossible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of\noperations, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December\u00a031, 2024, we had $448 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\nNote 15 \u2013 Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems\nand vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various\nfinancing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of\nthese VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements,\nwhich grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy\nsystems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing\ncustomer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature\nrather than participating.\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations\nand cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated\nexpenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as\nspecified in the agreements.\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor\u2019s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market\nvalue of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements.\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the\nfunds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have\nguaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund\u2019s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to\nthat of other funds.

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that\nany controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the\ndesired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource\nconstraints and that our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures\nrelative to their costs.\nBased on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December\u00a031, 2024,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were designed at a reasonable assurance level and were effective to provide reasonable\nassurance that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that (1)\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our\nassets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance\nwith authorizations of our management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n5/25/25, 1:46 PM\ntsla-20241231\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm\n131/157",
