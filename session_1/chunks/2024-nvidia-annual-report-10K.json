  "The dawn of a new computing \nera is unmistakably upon us.\nTwo transitions are occurring \nsimultaneously\u2014accelerated computing \nand generative AI\u2014transforming \nthe computer industry and every \nother industry worldwide.\nCPU scaling, the engine that has \ndriven the computer industry over \nthe past three decades, has slowed. \nSoftware developers have turned \nto accelerated computing to keep \npace with the exponentially growing \ndemand for computing in a cost- and \nenergy-sustainable way. The computing \nmodel pioneered by NVIDIA has \nreached critical mass and has been \nadopted broadly as the path forward.\nAccelerated computing will modernize \nthe world\u2019s trillion-dollar data \ncenter infrastructure. Its increased \nthroughput and cost and energy \nsavings are remarkable. Two NVIDIA \nHGX computers with Hopper GPUs \nthat together cost $500K can replace \n1,000 nodes of CPU servers that cost \n$10M for AI, scientific computing, \nor data processing workloads.\nFor data centers that are budget- or \npower-limited, NVIDIA delivers an order-\nof-magnitude increase in throughput. \nFor data centers optimized for \nthroughput, NVIDIA delivers an order-of-\nmagnitude reduction in cost and power. \nAccelerated computing is the best way \nto build sustainable data centers.\nWhen the cost of a fundamental \nresource, like computing, improves by \norders of magnitude, new methods \nare invented, and new utilities are \ndiscovered. AI researchers tapped \nNVIDIA CUDA to realize deep learning, \na machine learning algorithm that is \nincredibly compute-intensive. Deep \nlearning processes mountains of data \nto find patterns and relationships \nand learn predictive features. In \n2012, AlexNet shocked the artificial \nintelligence community by winning, by \na considerable margin, the ImageNet \ncomputer vision contest. Within a \ncouple of years, every computer vision \nalgorithm used deep learning, and \nwithin five years, computer vision had \nachieved superhuman object recognition \ncapabilities. AlexNet on NVIDIA CUDA \nwas the big bang of modern AI.\nWe recognized that AlexNet was more \nthan a computer vision breakthrough. \nWe imagined deep learning would \nfundamentally revolutionize software \nand, consequently, all computing. Deep \nlearning can scale to tackle many \npreviously impossible challenges with \nnew network architecture innovations, \nmore data, and more compute.\nIn the ensuing decade, NVIDIA \nset out to advance AI. We \npursued several strategies:\nReinvent every layer of computing, \nfrom GPU architecture, e.g., Tensor \nCores, to system interconnect, \ne.g., NVLink, systems, e.g., DGX, \nsoftware, e.g., cuDNN and TensorRT, \nto networking technologies, e.g., \nSHARP in-networking processing, \nand much more. We reinvented \ncomputing from the ground up.\nTransform into a data-center-scale \ncompany by combining with Mellanox, \nthe world\u2019s leading high-performance \nnetworking company. As computing \nlarge models and training data \nscales to require millions of trillions \nmore operations, we need not just \namazing chips but AI supercomputing \nsystems. Today, NVIDIA is an expert at \nevery computing layer, from chips to \nsoftware, and across the data center \n\u2014compute to networking. We have the \nexpertise and scale to help customers \nbuild AI infrastructures anywhere.\nBecome an AI expert by building NVIDIA \nAI Research and application-specific \nAI platforms\u2014full-stack AI platforms \nfor DLSS RTX neural graphics, DRIVE \nAV self-driving cars, Isaac robotics, \nACE digital humans, NeMo LLMs, \nBioNeMo digital biology, and Clara \nmedical imaging\u2014so that we can apply \nAI firsthand to create new markets. \nAutomotive has joined gaming as a \nmulti-billion-dollar run rate business. \nHealthcare and robotics are additional \nmulti-billion-dollar opportunities. \nDear NVIDIANs  \nand Stakeholders,",
  "Build a new ecosystem for the AI era \nby creating tools, libraries, and expert \ntechnical teams to support developers \ngoing after the AI revolution. The global \nNVIDIA ecosystem now approaches 5 \nmillion developers\u2014capping a record-\nsetting year for new developers. \nForty thousand companies have \nworked with NVIDIA. There are now \nmore than 3,300 GPU-accelerated \napplications. More than 18,000 \nstartups are building on NVIDIA. \nThese four strategies\u2014reinventing \nthe full computing stack, \nbuilding data-center-scale AI \nsupercomputers, conducting basic \nAI research and applying AI to \ncreate new markets, and building \na global ecosystem\u2014transformed \nNVIDIA and all of computing. \nTwelve years after AlexNet, NVIDIA \nis a full-stack, data-center-scale AI \ncompany that partners with nearly \nevery AI company in every industry \nworldwide. Then ChatGPT arrived, \nand the pace of AI accelerated even \nfaster. The era of generative AI began. \nComputers can now generate \ninformation based on human prompts. \nAt the heart of ChatGPT, large \nlanguage models, or LLMs, learned \nto understand human language, prior \nknowledge, and even some common \nsense from massive amounts of text. \nAnd not only human language. LLMs \nhave learned to understand text, speech, \nimages, and even amino acids and \nproteins, the language of biology. With \nmulti-modal learning\u2014for example, \nsimultaneously learning from language \nand images\u2014generative AI is gaining a \ndeeper understanding of the world and \ncan translate across different modalities. \nGiven a prompt such as \u201cgolden \nretriever wearing sunglasses and a \nwhite golden doodle with black leather \njacket surfing a wave, on a surfboard \nwith NVIDIA logo, in Maui during \nsunset, with hotels on the beach,\u201d \ngenerative AI can create an image.\nFrom an amino acid sequence, AI can \ngenerate the structure of a protein, \ne.g., the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.  \nThe combinations and possibilities  \nare endless.\nGenerative AI is the most transformative \nand consequential technology of \nour generation. Computers will \nunderstand people and the world \nand perform tasks that previously \nrequired human intelligence. With \ngenerative AI, computers can augment \nand amplify humans to perform tasks \nwith greater ease and speed, help \nus be more productive, and solve \nproblems previously unimaginable. \nResearchers use generative AI to \ncompose billions of chemical compounds \nand virtually test them as drugs against \na disease target. Climate scientists \nare using generative AI to map tens of \nthousands of potential trajectories of a \nweather pattern in seconds to predict \nthe path of a deadly storm better. \nThe automation of intelligence with \ngenerative AI will transform every \ncompany in the world\u2019s $100 trillion \nworth of industries. Startups and \nestablished companies spanning every \nconceivable domain and industry \nare investing billions of dollars to \nadvance and apply generative AI.\nWith AI supercomputers, we are \nmanufacturing intelligence in the form \nof tokens or floating-point numbers. \nIn the last industrial revolution, power \ngeneration plants produced electricity. \nIn this new industrial revolution, \nNVIDIA AI supercomputers are the AI \nfactories that produce intelligence. \nGenerative AI has enabled us to \nproduce something completely new.\nCompanies will operate a new type \nof facility, owned or rented, that \nproduces AI to augment, accelerate, \nand amplify the productivity of their \nemployees and business processes.\nNations have awakened to AI\u2019s impact. \nCountries are building sovereign AI \ninfrastructures. Governments see AI \nfactories as essential infrastructure \nto advance their society and local \nindustries. Nations such as Canada, \nFrance, India, Singapore, Japan, \nand others seek to develop their \nsovereign AI capabilities as they have \nrecognized their country\u2019s data is \ntheir most valuable natural resource.",
  "Generative AI is the most impactful \ninvention of our time, and as with \nelectricity and the internet, it impacts \neveryone and every industry. The \npotential of AI to help tackle the world\u2019s \nmost pressing challenges is incredible. \nTo maximize this potential, companies, \ngovernments, and societies are raising \nawareness of the capabilities of this \ntechnology, inventing capabilities to \nalign, guardrail, secure, and control \nmodels, sharing best practices, \ncreating new policies, discovering new \nsocial norms, encouraging debate, \nand inspiring whole new areas of \nresearch in AI security and safety.\nNVIDIA Accelerated \nComputing Reaches \nthe Tipping Point \nFor fiscal 2024, revenue was up \n126% to a record $60.9 billion. GAAP \nearnings per diluted share was $11.93, \nup 586% from a year ago. Non-GAAP \nearnings per diluted share were \n$12.96, up 288% from a year ago. \nNon-GAAP gross margin was 73.8%.\nFull-year Data Center revenue rose 217% \nto a record $47.5 billion. Demand for \nHopper architecture products remains \nstrong, and we have announced the \nBlackwell architecture, its successor.\nFull-year Gaming revenue rose 15% to \n$10.4 billion on strong demand for \nour expanded GeForce RTX 40 Series \nGPU lineup. \nFull-year revenue for Professional \nVisualization rose 1% to $1.6 billion.\nAutomotive full-year revenue this year \nrose 21% to $1.1 billion. \nA trillion dollars\u2019 worth of existing data \ncenters needs to be accelerated, and a \ntrillion more dollars is needed to expand \nthe installed base with AI factories \nin the next five years. We are in the \nmiddle of one of the most significant \nexpansions in computing history. NVIDIA \nis well-positioned to help our customers \nand partners realize this opportunity.\nWe hosted GTC live and in person for \nthe first time in five years. It was an \nelectric experience. Over 1,100 sessions, \nmore than 300 exhibits, and 20-plus \ntechnical workshops packed the San \nJose Convention Center to capacity, \nproviding learning and networking \nopportunities for our community and \necosystem unavailable anywhere else.\nJust 15 years ago, GTC easily fit inside \na hotel ballroom. Now, it is a can\u2019t-\nmiss event with more than 19,000 \nin-person registrations, almost \n300,000 virtual registrations, and \nmore than 12,000 people at the \nSAP Center for our keynote, which \nkicked off an unbelievable week. \nOur industry partners\u2019 unprecedented \ncollaboration and participation made \nthis year\u2019s GTC exceptional. The \npresence of industry giants like \nAmazon, Cisco, Dell, Google, HPE, \nIBM, Lenovo, Microsoft, Oracle, and \nSupermicro at GTC underscored the \nuniversal recognition of this moment in \ntechnology and their commitment to \nshaping the future alongside NVIDIA. \nSo, what now? How are we raising the bar?\nA New Computing \nPlatform for the New \nIndustrial Revolution\nWe are accelerating our roadmap \nacross the board. Generative AI models \nare increasing exponentially in scale, \ndoubling about every six months. If \nit takes twice as much data to train \nmodels twice as large, compute intensity \nis growing at 4X every six months. \nFurther, the demand for inferencing, \nor generating AI, on NVIDIA has \nincreased tremendously. When you \ninteract with a chatbot, which every \napplication or service will integrate in \nthe future, you are likely interacting \ndirectly with an NVIDIA GPU in the \ncloud. In the future, our interactions \nwith computers will be generated by AI \nspecifically for that interaction rather \nthan retrieved prerecorded text or \ncontent. Generative AI will let us reinvent \nhow we interact with computers, and \ndemand for GPUs will be massive. \nMulti-modality, large context windows, \nretrieval-augmented generation, \nmixture-of-experts, synthetic data \ngeneration, content protection, \nreasoning, planning, tool use, physical \nworld understanding, trillion-parameter",
  "LLMs, distillation to small models, high \nthroughput to high interactivity\u2014the \ninnovation rate of training and inference \nis incredibly high. Advances are \ncoming from every computer science \ndepartment and every industry. NVIDIA \nCUDA\u2019s rich software ecosystem and \nubiquity attracts more developers, \nwhich creates more advances \nthat drive more adoption. NVIDIA\u2019s \necosystem flywheel is in full throttle.\nOur customers and partners want \nmore and faster. A much bigger GPU \nis needed, so we built Blackwell. The \nmost advanced GPU-accelerated \ncomputing system ever built, the work \nof thousands of engineers and over two \ndecades of learning and craftsmanship, \nthe Blackwell platform is the computer \nfor the generative AI era and the new \nindustrial revolution. Blackwell adoption \nis already underway by every major \ncloud service provider, server maker, \nand leading AI company, including \nAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, \nOpenAI, Tesla, and xAI, with Blackwell-\nbased products expected to be rolled \nout by our partners later this year.\nThe numbers are incredible\u2014208 \nbillion transistors on the B200 Tensor \nCore GPU, 600,000 parts, 3,000 \npounds, two miles of NVLink cables, \n30X faster inference, 4X speedier \ntraining, and about 25X less cost of \nownership and energy consumption \nthan Hopper, and more than double \nthe bandwidth and memory of H100. \nBlackwell has six breakthrough \ntechnologies enabling AI training and \nreal-time LLM inference for models \nscaling up to 10 trillion parameters. \nThe second-generation transformer \nengine enables Blackwell to support \ndouble the compute and model sizes. \nFifth-generation NVLink delivers \ngroundbreaking 1.8TB/s bidirectional \nthroughput per GPU for seamless high-\nspeed communication among up to 576 \nGPUs for handling trillion-parameter \nLLMs. A built-in reliability, availability, \nand serviceability (RAS) engine uses \nAI-based preventative maintenance \nto run diagnostics and forecast \nreliability issues, increasing uptime and \nresiliency and reducing operational \ncosts. Advanced confidential computing \ncapabilities, including new native \ninterface encryption protocols, provide \nunprecedented levels of security without \ncompromising performance. Finally, \na dedicated decompression engine \ndelivers a leap for data processing. \nData processing is a top workload in \nthe world\u2019s data centers. Data is the \nraw material of AI, and the amount of \ndata generated is growing exponentially. \nPre- and post-processing data for AI \ncan often consume half of the total \nworkload. NVIDIA is singular in our \nability to accelerate data processing. \nNVIDIA Blackwell and NVIDIA\u2019s \nRAPIDS acceleration libraries will let \nus achieve an order-of-magnitude \nreduction in time, cost, and energy. \nThat\u2019s a mind-boggling amount \nof performance. Still, we needed \nsomething even more significant for \nthis generative industrial revolution. \nSo, we scaled it even further. The \nGB200 NVL72 combines 36 Grace \nBlackwell GB200 Superchips to act as \na single GPU in a multi-node, liquid-\ncooled, rack-scale system. Each GB200 \nconnects two NVIDIA B200 Tensor \nCore GPUs to an NVIDIA Grace CPU. \nBlackwell is a whole computing platform \nthat customers can configure into \nvarious AI infrastructures. The Blackwell \nplatform includes the new Quantum \nInfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet \nswitches, the X800 series, designed \nfor trillion-parameter-scale AI. \nIf NVIDIA GPUs are like the neurons, \nthen NVIDIA networks are like the \nsynapses. Both are vital to performance. \nThe new Spectrum X800 is the first \nhigh-performance networking platform \nto overcome Ethernet\u2019s fundamental \nshortcomings for distributed \nsupercomputing like AI. While Quantum \nX800 is best for dedicated AI factories, \nSpectrum X800 brings many of \nNVIDIA\u2019s networking technologies \nfor AI to the large Ethernet market.\nTraining a 1.8 trillion-parameter GPT \nmodel took about three to five months \nwith 25,000 NVIDIA Ampere architecture \nGPUs. With Hopper, it would take about \n8,000 GPUs and consume 15 megawatts \nover about three months. For Blackwell, \nin the same 90 days, it would need \na quarter of the GPUs and a quarter \nof the power of prior models for the \nsame task\u2014only about 4 megawatts.\nNVIDIA AI for Every \nIndustry and Enterprise\nGenerative AI will transform every \nindustry. NVIDIA has already applied \nAI to build several multi-billion-\ndollar verticals\u2014gaming, healthcare, \nautomotive, and robotics. We are \nnow bringing NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated \ncomputing and AI to the enterprise. \nEnterprises have not historically been a \nmarket for GPUs and high-performance \ncomputing. Generative AI changes that. \nCopilots, assistants, and agents will \naugment and amplify every employee \nand business process in the future, \nand enterprises will be significant \nmarkets for NVIDIA GPU computing.",
  "The NVIDIA AI Enterprise software \nplatform centers on the idea that \nmany companies will want to build and \noperate proprietary AI models, and \nevery company will want to integrate \nAI into its business processes to \naccelerate and improve productivity. \nNVIDIA AI Enterprise strategy has \nseveral pillars: NVIDIA\u2019s expertise \nin building AI models, the NVIDIA \nNeMo suite of tools to develop and \ncustomize LLMs, NVIDIA DGX Cloud, \nwhich is our AI factory, and NVIDIA \nNIM inference microservices, which \nare AI containers that run everywhere \nthere are NVIDIA GPUs. We are an AI \nfoundry like TSMC is a chip foundry. \nWe manufacture custom NIMs like \nTSMC manufactures custom chips. \nAnd like a great foundry, we have the \ntechnology, skills, scale, and business \nmodel to partner with any company.\nNIM is a groundbreaking new way to \npackage and deliver AI software. We \nintegrated a mountain of complex \nsoftware technology to build NIMs \nso developers and enterprises can \nquickly develop AI applications. These \npretrained models are optimized and \ncloud-native, shortening the time to \nmarket and simplifying the deployment \nof generative AI models anywhere. \nNIMs can learn to understand \nproprietary information specific to \na company so businesses can create \nand deploy custom applications \non their platforms while retaining \nfull ownership and control of their \nintellectual property. NIMs are built \nfor portability and control, enabling \nmodel deployment across various \ninfrastructures, from local workstations \nto cloud to on-premises data centers.\nAdobe, Box, Cadence, Cloudera, Cohesity, \nCrowdStrike, Dropbox, Getty Images, \nNetApp, SAP, ServiceNow, Shutterstock, \nand Snowflake are among the first to \naccess NVIDIA NIMs. ServiceNow, for \nexample, uses NIMs to develop and \ndeploy new domain-specific copilots for \ncustomer care and service assurance.\nSupercharging Health \nSciences and Drug Discovery\nGenerative AI has supercharged \ninnovation in healthcare. At GTC, we \nintroduced more than two dozen \nhealthcare NIMs for drug discovery, \nmedical technology, and digital \nhealth. AWS and Microsoft Azure \nare incorporating NVIDIA NIMs \nin their healthcare platforms.\nOur partnerships in the medical \ntechnology and biopharmaceuticals \nsegments are already making huge \nimpacts. Generative AI for computer-\naided drug discovery is seeing \nbroad adoption. Genentech uses \nNVIDIA BioNeMo to customize NIMs \nintegrated into its drug discovery \nworkflows. Amgen is taking drug \ndiscovery to light speed, building AI \nmodels trained on one of the world\u2019s \nmost extensive human datasets. \nJohnson & Johnson MedTech is \npartnering with NVIDIA to build its \ndigital ecosystem for intelligent \nsurgical and medical instruments on \nNVIDIA IGX and Holoscan platforms.\nThe rate of innovation in healthcare \nis thrilling. Hundreds of tech startups \nare partnering with NVIDIA and using \ngenerative AI to revolutionize health \nmonitoring, drug discovery, robotic \nsurgery, and patient care. Generative AI \nwill transform healthcare into one of the \nworld\u2019s largest technology industries.\nExpanded Graphics and \nGaming Leadership\nComputer graphics remains core to \nNVIDIA. Accelerated computing has \npowered unimaginable advances and \ndelivered tremendous performance \ngains of 10 million-X in the last two \ndecades. We pioneered RTX DLSS neural \ngraphics, the fusion of AI and ray-\ntracing computer graphics to enhance \nperformance and visual quality. Though \nseemingly unbelievable when we first \nlaunched RTX and DLSS at SIGGRAPH \n2018, real-time ray tracing and AI-\ngenerated images have revolutionized \ncomputer graphics. With DLSS, we \ncompute one pixel, while AI generates \n15, allowing us to dedicate available \ncomputation to creating a few beautiful \nsamples because AI can predict the \nrest. This hybrid physics-AI method will \nrevolutionize many fields of science.\nNVIDIA is again driving a broad \ntransformation powered by the \nexpansion of AI computing to PCs. \nGenerative AI is quickly emerging as the \nnew \u201ckiller app\u201d for high-performance \nPCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs define the most",
  "performant AI PCs and workstations. \nWith over 100 million RTX GPUs in use, \nNVIDIA RTX is the natural platform \nfor AI application developers.\nNVIDIA ACE is a digital avatar cloud \nAPI with customizable microservices. \nIt lets developers bring game \ncharacters to life and deploy them \nacross various platforms and \nclouds with secure and consistent \nperformance. Realistic and engaging \ngame characters are now possible \nwith generative AI and LLMs. Digital \nhumans will be the next leap in gaming.\nGeForce NOW cloud gaming had an \nincredible year. There are currently \nmore than 1,900 games on GeForce \nNOW enjoyed by 30 million registered \ngamers daily across 110 countries.\nSteering Automotive Growth\nThe rapid advance of generative AI \ntechnology will propel the shift from \nsoftware-defined vehicles to AI-defined \nvehicles. NVIDIA collaborates closely \nwith automotive manufacturers, \nincluding Continental, Desay, Flex, \nFoxconn, Lenovo, Quanta, and ZF, to \ncreate cutting-edge electric vehicles \nfor the world market. These vehicles \nutilize the advanced NVIDIA DRIVE \nHyperion platform and NVIDIA \nDRIVE AGX systems-on-a-chip. \nDesigned and optimized for generative \nAI utilizing NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell \narchitecture, DRIVE AGX Thor will \nrevolutionize an automotive landscape \nwhere gen AI redefines the driving \nexperience.

Digitalization of manufacturing \nhas been challenging. Representing \nand predicting physical properties \nfrom start to finish in manufacturing \nis difficult. With the Universal Scene \nDescription (OpenUSD) format, \nevery step\u2014from design, simulation, \nand manufacturing to marketing\u2014\ncan be connected to a standard \ninterchangeable representation. And \nwith generative AI and accelerated \ncomputing, the massive and physically \ncomplex worlds of manufacturing can \nbe simulated virtual environments.\nBased on OpenUSD and powered by \nNVIDIA\u2019s state-of-the-art graphics, \nphysics simulation, generative AI, \naccelerated computing, and cloud \nsupercomputing technologies, NVIDIA \nOmniverse is a one-of-a-kind, virtual-\nworld emulation engine. Omniverse \ncloud APIs make it easy to connect \nto the world\u2019s leading industrial tools \nand platforms. Designed parts from \ndifferent tools and different stages of \nmanufacturing can be integrated and \ncomposed inside Omniverse to represent \na digital twin of the whole product.\nOmniverse digital twins help companies \ndo virtual product integration, virtually \nstart up new factories, test new \nmanufacturing flows, and refine \nplant layouts to improve operations. \nDigital twins are the essential \ndigital representations of the \nindustrial digitalization process and \nOmniverse is the operating system.\nNVIDIA works with industry leaders like \nAnsys, Cadence, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, \nSiemens, and many others. They \nuse Omniverse technologies to help \ncustomers design, simulate, build, and \noperate physically based digital twins \nand fully realize their potential. We \nalso expanded our partnership with \nMicrosoft to bring NVIDIA Omniverse \nCloud Services to Azure customers.\nThe ChatGPT Moment \nfor Robotics Is Coming\nThe next wave of AI is versatile and high-\nfunctioning robotics, and it\u2019s around \nthe corner. AI will understand us and \nthe physical world, and like ChatGPT\u2019s \nability to generate a response from \nour instruction, robots will generate \nmanipulation from our instruction.",

We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our \nstockholders see our governance and executive pay practices as well-structured.  In the Fall of 2023, we contacted our \ntop institutional stockholders, representing an aggregate ownership of 31%, to gain insights into their views on corporate \nsustainability practices, and diversity and inclusion.  \nHighlights of our corporate governance practices include: \u00a0\n\u00fc All Board members independent, except for our CEO\n\u00fc Independent Lead Director\n\u00fc Proxy access\n\u00fc Declassified Board\n\u00fc Majority voting for directors\n\u00fc Active Board oversight of enterprise risk and risk \nmanagement\n\u00fc Stockholders can call a special meeting\n\u00fc 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at \nmeetings of the Board and applicable committees\n\u00fc Independent directors frequently meet in executive\n     sessions\n\u00fc At least annual Board and committee self-assessments \n\u00fc Annual stockholder outreach, including Lead Director \nparticipation\n\u00fc Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and NEOs\nAdvisory Approval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2024 (Proposal 2)\nWe are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d to approve our NEOs\u2019 \ncompensation.  The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of \npaying for performance; providing competitive pay so that we may attract and retain a high-caliber executive team; \naligning our executives\u2019 interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value; and achieving simplicity and \ntransparency with our compensation program.  The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our \u201csay-on-pay\u201d \nvotes annually. \nExecutive Compensation Highlights\nOur executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance.  We utilize compensation elements that align \nour NEOs\u2019 interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value.  Our NEOs\u2019 compensation is heavily \nweighted toward performance-based, \u201cat-risk\u201d variable cash and long-term equity awards that are only earned if the \nCompany achieves pre-established corporate financial metrics, subject to caps on maximum payout.  For the last several \nyears, over 90% of our CEO\u2019s and over 50% of our other NEOs\u2019 target pay has been performance-based and at-risk, and \n100% of our CEO\u2019s equity awards have been in the form of PSUs.\nTo motivate our NEOs to focus on operational efficiencies and providing value-added products, the CC provided our \nexecutives with an opportunity to earn Additional SY PSUs if we achieved (i) Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income at \n8",
  "or above Base Compensation Plan and (ii) a Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin goal.  In light of an increasingly complex \nmacroeconomic environment, the CC set (a) Base Compensation Plan goals close to actual performance for Fiscal 2023 \nand (b) Stretch Compensation Plan goals at levels that would require year-over-year growth, representing extremely \nstrong financial performance to further align corporate performance and executive pay.\nFinancial Performance and Link to Executive Pay\nAs described further in our CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of \nfinancial measures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success.  The table below shows our goals \nfor the applicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2024 and their respective impact on our executive \npay.\nPERFORMANCE GOALS\nVariable Cash Plan\nSY PSUs\nMY PSUs\nFiscal 2024 \nRevenue\nPayout as a \n% of Target \nOpportunity \nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP \nOperating Income (1)\nShares Eligible to Vest as a \n% of Target Opportunity \nFiscal 2022 to \n2024    \n3-Year Relative \nTSR\nShares \nEligible to \nVest as a % of \nTarget \nOpportunity\nThreshold\n$20.0 billion\n20%\n$4.6 billion\n20%\n25th percentile\n25%\nBase Compensation \nPlan \n$26.0 billion\n100%\n$9.4 billion\n100%\n50th percentile\n100%\nStretch \nCompensation Plan \n$29.5 billion\n200%\n$11.9 billion\nCEO 150% \nOther NEOs 200%\nAdditional 50% possible for \nall NEOs (2)\n75th percentile\nCEO 150% \nOther NEOs \n200%\nPERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTS\nVariable Cash Plan\nSY PSUs\nMY PSUs\nPerformance \nAchievement for \nPeriod Ended Fiscal \n2024 (3)\n$60.9 billion revenue\n \n$37.1 billion Non-GAAP Operating Income (1)\nFor Additional SY PSUs only, 73.8% Non-GAAP\nGross Margin (1)\n 99th percentile 3-year TSR \nrelative to S&P 500\nPayout as % of \nTarget Opportunity\n200%\nWith Additional SY PSUs, CEO 200%\nOther NEOs 250%\nCEO 150%\nOther NEOs 200%\n(1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below in our CD&A for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.\n(2) Contingent upon the Company achieving (a) Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Base Compensation Plan of $9.4 billion or more and (b) Fiscal \n2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin of 68.5% or more.  \n(3) See Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation below in our CD&A for a description and further discussion of revenue, Non-GAAP \nOperating Income, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, and 3-year relative TSR.\nRatification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2025 (Proposal 3)\nAlthough not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC\u2019s selection of PwC as our independent registered \npublic accounting firm for Fiscal 2025 because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice.  If our stockholders do \nnot ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC.  Even if the selection is \nratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that \nsuch a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.\nStockholder Proposal: Simple Majority Vote (Proposal 4)\nA stockholder is asking our Board to take steps to replace the supermajority voting provisions in our Charter and Bylaws \nwith a simple majority standard.  The proposal is advisory only, and our Board does not recommend a vote either for or \nagainst the proposal.  Approval of the proposal would not, by itself, implement a majority voting standard, and our Board \nand our stockholders would need to take subsequent action to replace the supermajority voting provisions in our Charter \nand Bylaws with a simple majority standard.  \n9",

Our 2024 Meeting will take place \nvirtually on Wednesday, June 26, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. \nVirtual Meeting Philosophy and Benefits\nThe Board believes that holding the 2024 Meeting in a virtual format invites stockholder participation, while reducing the \ncosts to stockholders and the Company associated with an in-person meeting.  This balance allows the 2024 Meeting to \nremain focused on matters directly relevant to the interests of stockholders in an efficient way.  We have designed the \nvirtual format to protect stockholder rights, including by offering multiple opportunities to ask questions, publishing \nanswers to questions received before or during the 2024 Meeting on our Investor Relations website, and providing an \narchived copy of the webcast after the 2024 Meeting.\nMeeting Attendance\nIf you were an NVIDIA stockholder as of the close of business on the April 29, 2024 record date, or if you hold a valid \nproxy, you can attend, ask questions during, and vote at our 2024 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/\nNVDA2024.

During the 2024 Meeting, we will answer as many stockholder-\nsubmitted questions related to the business of the 2024 Meeting as time permits.  As soon as practicable following the \n2024 Meeting, we will publish and answer questions received on our Investor Relations website.  We intend to group \nquestions and answers by topic and substantially similar questions will be answered only once.  To promote fairness to all \nstockholders and efficient use of the Company\u2019s resources, we will respond to one question per stockholder.  We reserve \nthe right to exclude questions regarding topics that are not pertinent to company business or are not otherwise suitable \nfor the conduct of the 2024 Meeting.\nQuorum and Voting\nTo hold our 2024 Meeting, we need a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the \nApril 29, 2024 record date, or a quorum, represented at the 2024 Meeting either by attendance virtually or by proxy.  On \nApril 29, 2024, there were 2,459,834,197 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, meaning that \n1,229,917,099 shares must be represented at the 2024 Meeting or by proxy to have a quorum.  A list of stockholders \nentitled to vote at the close of business on the record date will be available at our headquarters, 2788 San Tomas \n11",

  "Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors\nThe NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for \nrecommendation to the Board for approval.  In accordance with our Corporate Governance Policies and the NCGC Charter, \nthe NCGC is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee\u2019s background and experience to ensure that a \nbroad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC may conduct appropriate and necessary inquiries \ninto the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates and may engage a professional search firm to identify and \nassist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. \u00a0The NCGC \nhas not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead \nconsiders numerous factors regarding the nominee, taking into account our current and future business models, \nincluding the following: \n\u2022 Integrity and candor\n\u2022 Independence\n\u2022 Senior leadership and operational experience\n\u2022 Professional, technical and industry knowledge\n\u2022 Financial expertise\n\u2022 Financial community experience (including as an investor in \nother companies)\n\u2022 Marketing, communications and brand management \nbackground\n\u2022 Governance and public company board experience\n\u2022 Experience with emerging technologies and new business \nmodels\n\u2022 Regulatory, legal, and risk management expertise, including in \ncybersecurity matters\n\u2022 Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, or \nmembership in another underrepresented community\n\u2022 Human capital management experience\n\u2022 Experience in academia\n\u2022 Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to \nBoard responsibilities and Company oversight\n\u2022 Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole \nrather than special interest groups or constituencies\n\u2022 All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our \nstockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers, or other \npersons with a relationship to NVIDIA\n\u2022 For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including \npast attendance, participation and contributions to the \nactivities of the Board and its committees\nThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance \nof tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the Board \nbenefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in \nnew perspectives and ideas through the appointment of three new directors since 2020.  The Board also regularly rotates \ncommittee membership and chairpersons to help promote a diversity of viewpoints on the Board committees.  Our \nlonger-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our \nactivities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances the Board\u2019s oversight of strategy \nand risks.  Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, as well as the increasingly complex \nmacroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are a significant asset to the Board.  Our \nnewer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity, familiarity with technology \ndevelopments at leading academic institutions, and senior management and operating experience as well as finance \nexperience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board \nreview each director\u2019s individual performance, including the director\u2019s past contributions, outside experiences and \nactivities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to \nNVIDIA and the Board.\nThe Board and the NCGC continue to seek highly qualified women and individuals from underrepresented groups to \ninclude in the initial pool of director candidates.  The Board\u2019s commitment to achieving a diverse and inclusive \nmembership is demonstrated by our director nominees.  Four of our directors are women and three of our directors are \nethnically and/or racially diverse. Our three newest members enhance the Board\u2019s gender, ethnic, and/or racial diversity. \n16",

  "Information About the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance\nIndependence of the Members of the Board of Directors\nNasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Policies (as further described below) require that a majority of our directors \nnot have a relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their \nresponsibilities and that they meet any other qualification requirements required by the SEC and Nasdaq.  \nDr. Drell served as Provost of Stanford University from 2017 to 2023.  NVIDIA has entered into transactions, relationships, \nor arrangements during the past three fiscal years with Stanford University for the support of research and activities \nrelated to NVIDIA\u2019s industry and line of business.  The amount that NVIDIA paid in each of the last three fiscal years to \nStanford University, and the amount received in each fiscal year by NVIDIA from Stanford University, did not, in any of the \nprevious three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $200,000 or 1% of either entity\u2019s consolidated gross revenues.\nAfter considering the above arrangements, and all other relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined \nthat, except for Mr. Huang, all of our directors are \u201cindependent\u201d as defined by Nasdaq\u2019s rules and regulations.  The Board \nalso determined that all members of our AC, CC, and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, \nand that each of Mr. Seawell and Ms. Lora of the AC, and Mr. Jones who will join the AC after the Annual Meeting, are \n\u201caudit committee financial experts\u201d as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nOur Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having an \nindependent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders.  Our Lead \nDirector is an integral part of our Board structure and critical to our effective corporate governance.  The independent \ndirectors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis.  The Board \nrecognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and its annual \nreview includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA\u2019s evolving needs and \nserves in the best interest of its stockholders.  \nOur Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because the active involvement of each of our \nindependent directors, combined with the qualifications, significant responsibilities, and strong oversight by our Lead \nDirector, provide balance on the Board and promote independent oversight of our management and affairs.  Our Board \nalso believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because it effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and \noversight between management and our independent directors and it provides the right foundation to pursue the \nCompany\u2019s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in light of the evolution of our business and operating \nenvironment.  Our CEO has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, \nand the Lead Director facilitates our Board\u2019s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between \nmanagement and our Board, and supports our Board\u2019s consideration of key governance matters.  This arrangement \npromotes open dialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive \nsessions without the presence of our CEO, which are led by our Lead Director.  We believe that our current structure best \nserves stockholders, without the need to appoint a person to serve as chairperson of the Board.\nUnder our corporate governance policies, the Board may select a chairperson in its discretion, but, if it does not, a Lead \nDirector shall be designated annually by a majority of the independent directors and identified in the Company\u2019s proxy \nstatement.  These policies help to ensure a robust independent leadership structure on our Board. \nWhile the Board has the discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or \nchairperson, if any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the \ninterests of our stockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations.  If in the \nfuture our CEO were to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would \ncontinue to appoint an independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise \nrepresent the Board independently from the Company\u2019s management team.  Any changes to the Board\u2019s leadership \nstructure would take into account stockholder views, including through our ongoing stockholder outreach, and would be",

In his role as NCGC Chairperson, our \nLead Director will continue to lead discussions, provide input, and oversee the design of the Board itself.\nMr. Neal has served as a director since 2019 and has extensive experience as a trial lawyer and has advised numerous \ncompanies, boards of directors, and individuals on corporate governance and legal matters.

The \nLead Director makes themself available for consultation with major stockholders pursuant to our Corporate Governance \nPolicies.  As Lead Director, Mr. Neal has participated in our annual stockholder outreach meetings and we expect this \npractice to continue.\n26",
  "Committees of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has three committees: an AC, a CC, and a NCGC.  Each of these committees operates under a written charter, \nwhich may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.\nCommittee assignments are determined based on background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a \ncommittee.  Our Board believes regular committee rotations are a good corporate governance practice which introduces \ndiverse perspectives and ideas, more fully informs its members regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, \nand benefits each committee and the Board as a whole.

  "Role of the Board in Risk Oversight\nThe Board oversees risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its committees.  The \noversight responsibility of our Board and its committees is enabled by management reporting processes, including our \nERM process, that are designed to provide visibility to our Board about the identification, assessment, and management \nof critical risks and management\u2019s risk mitigation strategies.

Given the importance of topics like information security to \nour business, which includes cybersecurity, the Board has determined that these matters should remain under the full \nBoard\u2019s oversight.  The AC also reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information security policies \nand practices and the internal controls regarding information security risks.  The AC receives regular information security \nupdates from management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.  The Board also \nreceives annual reports on information security matters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security \nteam.\nThe involvement of our Board committees is designed to increase the effectiveness of the Board's risk oversight by \nallocating authority and responsibility, as set forth in committee charters, to the particular committee that is best \nequipped to provide guidance and oversight regarding the operations, issues and risks presented, with escalation to the \nfull Board as appropriate.  The AC also meets in executive session with the leaders of our key control functions, which \nensures that Board members have direct access to these teams, and that these teams are appropriately staffed and \nresourced.  Committee chairpersons provide regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed by their \n29",
  "committees, including key risks, and the committees work together with the full Board to facilitate the receipt of the \ninformation deemed necessary to fulfill their oversight responsibilities over our risk management activities.  Our Board \nbelieves that our Board leadership structure helps to facilitate its oversight of risk at the Company because its strong \nindependent Lead Director and independent committees proactively provide oversight of and engage with management \non the Company\u2019s key risks.  For further discussion, please see Board Leadership Structure above.\nEach year management leads an ERM process, which includes a formal assessment of the Company\u2019s risk environment \nand facilitates the provision of regular reports to senior management, including the CEO, regarding the actions, \nstrategies, processes, controls, and procedures specific to managing, mitigating, and anticipating significant risks.  The \nERM process is overseen and reviewed by the Board and the AC on an annual basis.  Our ERM process identifies, assesses, \nand manages the Company\u2019s most significant risks and uncertainties that could materially impact the long-term health of \nthe Company or prevent the achievement of strategic objectives. \nOur ERM team works with senior management, as well as our Lead Director and committee chairpersons, to identify \nmajor risks to the Company.  We do not have a member of senior management with the title of Chief Compliance Officer.  \nInstead, our ERM process and action plan are reviewed by our CEO and other NEOs who report directly to our CEO, other \nmembers of senior management, and our internal audit team. This full team of leaders is responsible for managing key \nrisks specific to their functional areas. \nThe ERM process facilitates the incorporation of risk assessment and evaluation into the strategic planning process. \nBecause risks are considered in conjunction with the Company\u2019s operations and strategies, including long-term \nstrategies, risks are identified and evaluated across different timeframes, including in the short-, intermediate-, and long-\nterm, depending on the specific risk.  In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, intermediate-, \nand long-term potential impacts on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations, which involves \nlooking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers, and emerging trends, and they \nconsider the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company\u2019s risk mitigation efforts.  The Company\u2019s significant risks \nidentified through the ERM process are reviewed periodically, but at least annually with the Board and AC, including the \npotential impact and likelihood of the risks materializing over the relevant timeframe, future threats and trends, and the \nactions, strategies, processes, controls, and procedures used or to be implemented to manage and mitigate the risks.  As \na part of this annual process, the Board provides feedback on risk management strategies, as well as the ERM process.  \nThe Board and its committees receive updates, as appropriate, during the year from management regarding the risk \nmanagement processes, operations and organization, the mitigation of key existing and emerging risks and, as \nappropriate, provide feedback to address these matters, including those related to cybersecurity, trade compliance, and \nstrategy.  Management\u2019s regular attendance at Board and committee meetings provides Board members direct access to \nour management team and the opportunity for the Board to receive updates on our risk exposure.  Further, the agendas \nfor each Board meeting, as determined by our CEO and Lead Director, are developed and adjusted throughout the year, to \nadapt to any emerging risks or key topics.\nThe Company\u2019s ERM process is designed so that the Board can respond to risks in a manner that closely aligns to the \nCompany\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures.  The ERM results are reviewed and considered by members of \nmanagement who are responsible for our public reporting and the Board.  Our public reports are prepared by \nmanagement who participate in the ERM process, and are reviewed by the Board or its committees, as appropriate, and \nthis process contributes to the effective functioning of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Our risk oversight \nprocesses and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately identify potential risks for disclosure. \nThe Board, each of its committees, and senior management have in the past and may continue to engage outside \nadvisors, experts, and consultants, to help develop and analyze the Company\u2019s risk management and mitigation efforts \nand associated controls and procedures, as well as to help the Company anticipate future threats and trends which could \nhave an impact on our business.\nCorporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors",
  "have an impact on our business.\nCorporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors\nThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Board has the necessary authority and \nprocesses in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent \nof our management.  These policies include practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, \nregular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, senior \nmanagement performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation.  These policies may be viewed under \nGovernance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.\nExecutive Sessions of the Board\nAs required under Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, our independent directors meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions at \nwhich only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2024, our independent \ndirectors met in both types of executive sessions at four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.\n30",
  "Director Attendance at Annual Meeting\nWe expect that our directors will attend each annual meeting, absent a valid reason.  All Board members as of our 2023 \nMeeting attended our 2023 Meeting.\nBoard Self-Assessments\nThe NCGC oversees an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside legal counsel for NVIDIA \ninterviews each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which he or she \nserves.  The interviews solicit ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board and/or \ncommittee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation, \nacquisition activity, and other key matters.  The interviews also focus on Board process and identifying specific issues \nwhich should be discussed in the future.  After these evaluations are complete, our outside corporate counsel summarizes \nthe results, reviews them with our Lead Director, and then submits the summary for discussion by the NCGC. \nIn response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2024, our Board determined to focus on competitive advantage, \ngrowth management, vertical initiatives, AI regulations, supply chain, management development and company culture, \nand geopolitical and regulatory risks.  The Board also determined to continue to focus on the Board\u2019s composition and \nprocess for Board refreshment.\nDirector Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving \neligible director continuing education programs.  Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination \nof internally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative \nsupport for attendance at qualifying academic or other independent programs. \nDirector Time Commitment and Outside Board Memberships\nOur directors are expected to devote sufficient time to Board and committee duties and to understanding the Company\u2019s \nbusiness. The NCGC reviews the other commitments of potential Board candidates, and does so annually for existing \nBoard members, to determine if this expectation can be met. In making this determination, the NCGC considers, among \nother factors, stakeholder guidelines regarding numerical limits on public company boards on which a director may sit. \nNone of our directors serve on more than two public company boards (including NVIDIA), and none of our non-employee \ndirectors serve as a CEO or executive officer of a public company.\nDirector Stock Ownership Guidelines\nOur Corporate Governance Policies require each non-employee director to hold shares of our common stock with a total \nvalue equal to six times the annual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a \ndirector (or six times his base salary, in the case of the CEO).  The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held \nin trust, and shares held by immediate family members, but unvested or unexercised equity awards do not count for \npurposes of this ownership calculation.  Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach \nthe ownership threshold.  Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder \ninterests.\nEach non-employee director and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the \nexception of Ms. Lora, who joined our Board in 2023 and has five years from joining the Board to reach the ownership \nthreshold.\nHedging and Pledging Policy \nUnder our Insider Trading Policy, our directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not hedge their \nownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments \nrelated to NVIDIA stock or debt.  Additionally, directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not \npurchase NVIDIA stock on margin, borrow against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account, or pledge NVIDIA stock as \ncollateral for a loan.  \nSenior Management Development\nWe believe in extensive leadership development.  Our management structure ensures that over 60 senior managers work \ndirectly with our CEO to execute our corporate strategies.  This approach results in strategic alignment, exposes leaders \nto a broad spectrum of corporate activities, and presents the Board with a pool of excellent candidates for future \npromotion. Our CEO also selects senior leaders to engage directly with the Board on key initiatives and provides periodic \nupdates to our Board on management development.\n31",
  "Outside Advisors\nThe Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our \nexpense.  The Board need not obtain management\u2019s consent to retain outside advisors.  In addition, the principal \ncommittees need not obtain either the Board\u2019s or management\u2019s consent to retain outside advisors.\nCode of Conduct\nOur directors, executives, and employees are expected to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics, \nand honesty.  Our credibility and reputation depend upon their good judgment, ethical standards, and personal integrity.  \nOur Code of Conduct applies to all executive officers, directors, and employees, including our principal executive officer, \nprincipal financial officer, and principal accounting officer.

We also regularly \ntrain our employees on our Code of Conduct and other policies.\nThe Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations \nsection of our website, at www.nvidia.com.  If we make any amendments to either code, or grant any waiver from a \nprovision of either code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or \nwaiver on our website or in a report on Form 8-K.  Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference \ninto this or any other report we file with the SEC.\nCorporate Hotline\nWe have established an independent corporate hotline to allow any employee, contractor, customer, or partner to \nconfidentially and anonymously submit a complaint about any accounting, internal controls, auditing, Code of Conduct, or \nother matter of concern (unless prohibited by local privacy laws).\nStockholder Communications with the Board of Directors\nStockholders who wish to communicate with the Board regarding nominations of directors or other matters may do so by \nsending \nelectronic \nwritten \ncommunications \naddressed \nto \nTimothy \nS. \nTeter, \nour \nSecretary, \nat \nshareholdermeeting@nvidia.com.  All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board will be \ncompiled by our Secretary.  If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, \nto the chairperson of the AC, CC, or NCGC.  Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which \nwill determine whether these matters should be presented to the Board.  The NCGC will give serious consideration to all \nsuch matters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws.\nMajority Vote Standard\nUnder our Bylaws, in an uncontested election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast votes FOR or AGAINST the \nelection of directors or to ABSTAIN from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to \nsuch election of directors.  A director shall be elected by the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast with \nrespect to that director, meaning the number of shares voted FOR a director must exceed the number of votes cast \nAGAINST that director.  If the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the \nnumber of AGAINST votes, such incumbent director shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the Board.  The NCGC \nor other committee that may be designated by the Board will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept \nor reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken.  The Board will act on such committee\u2019s \nrecommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date of certification of the \nelection results.  In making their decision, such committee and the Board will evaluate the best interests of the Company \nand its stockholders and shall consider all factors and information deemed relevant.  The director who tenders his or her \nresignation will not participate in such committee\u2019s recommendation or the Board\u2019s decision.\nIn a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, stockholders will \nbe given the choice to cast FOR or WITHHOLD votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any \nother vote with respect to such election of directors.  Our directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented \nat any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at that meeting.  The directors receiving \nthe greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.",
  "the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.\nIn either case, abstentions and broker non-votes will each be counted as present for purposes of determining the \npresence of a quorum but will have no effect on the vote.\nStockholder Special Meeting Right\nAs part of our Board and management\u2019s comprehensive review of current corporate governance practices, our Board \nadopted an amendment to our Bylaws in March 2024 to permit stockholders who own at least 15% of the voting power of \nall the then-outstanding shares of voting stock of the Company, and who have owned such shares continuously for at \n32",
  "least one year, to request a special meeting of stockholders, provided that the stockholders satisfy the disclosure, timing \nand other requirements set forth in our Bylaws intended to ensure that stockholders receive adequate, timely, and \naccurate information in connection with a special meeting.  Our Board believes that this special meeting right strikes an \nappropriate balance by ensuring that stockholders have a meaningful right to call a special meeting to act on \nextraordinary, pressing events, while also protecting the Company and its broader stockholder base against narrow and \nshort-term interests.\nBoard Meeting Information\nThe Board met four times during Fiscal 2024, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic \ndirection of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and \nother matters facing NVIDIA.

  "Corporate Sustainability\nNVIDIA invents computing technologies that improve lives and address global challenges. Our goal is to integrate sound \nCS principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. Our Board and management believe that environmental \nstewardship, social responsibility, and solid governance are important to our business strategy and long-term value \ncreation. While the full Board has ultimate responsibility for CS matters that impact our business, each committee of the \nBoard oversees CS matters across our business operations in the areas that align with their respective responsibilities. \nThe NCGC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our policies, issues, and reporting related to \nsustainability, including overall sustainability strategy, risks, and opportunities, and related programs and initiatives. Our \nCS team updates the NCGC at least semiannually on these topics, as well as pertinent regulations and stakeholder inputs, \nand gathers feedback from the NCGC on issues such as climate change, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. The CS \nteam also reports on sustainability issues to the full Board annually.\nIn Fiscal 2024, we launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee, or the CSSC, comprised of members of our \nexecutive leadership team.  The CSSC is responsible for overseeing and providing input on our sustainability strategy and \nprogram.  Feedback from the Board, the NCGC and CSSC, along with specific input from our executive team, helps to \ndetermine the focus and scope of our sustainability strategy and program.\nThe following sections provide an overview of our principles and practices.  More information can be found on the \nCorporate Sustainability section of our website and in our annual Sustainability Report.

The CC provides oversight of the Company\u2019s human capital management, including policies and strategies \nregarding recruiting, development, retention, diversity, inclusion, and belonging.\nRecruitment, Development, and Retention\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have \nbeen successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA.  We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand \nand differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent.  Our workforce is 83% technical and \n49% hold advanced degrees.  Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in \nglobal female hiring in each channel.  Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in \nFiscal 2024 coming from employee referrals.\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted \ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback.  We offer tuition reimbursement programs \nto subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications.  We implemented a career coaching service to provide \none-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility.

We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community Resource Groups and \ncontinuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents.\nOur support has been enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing \nteam of world-class talent and their families.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all \nemployees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that \nincludes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino \ncandidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\n\u2022\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\n\u2022 \nEmbedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the \ninterview process and find internal opportunities;\n\u2022 \nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future \nleaders;\n\u2022 \nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\n\u2022 \nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for \ndiversity;\n\u2022 \nTracking equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\n\u2022 \nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts.\nAs of the end of Fiscal 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our \nworkforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nWe strive to provide equitable compensation and opportunities for advancement to all employees and to achieve \npromotion parity based on gender, race, and ethnicity. \nSince 2020, we have used a third-party firm to analyze our pay practices and promotion activity across rating, education, \nyears of experience, job function, family, and level.  The review has determined that we\u2019ve achieved pay parity, defined as \nno statistically significant differences in compensation based on gender, race, or ethnicity, for the past several years, and \nwe plan to continue doing so.\nIn Fiscal 2024, as we promoted many in our workforce, women continue to be promoted at an approximately equal rate to \nmen.\nFlexible Working Environment\nWe support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under \ncertain conditions.  This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes \nNVIDIA a great place to work.\nDuring Fiscal 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days off a \nquarter for employees to rest and recharge.  \nProduct Value Chain\nWe seek to promote human rights throughout our supply chain and expect our suppliers to respect human rights \nwhenever they provide products or services for us. \n35",

This vote is intended to address the overall \ncompensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement, rather than any \nspecific compensation component.\nIn response to our stockholders\u2019 preference, our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes. \nThis advisory proposal is not binding on the Board nor us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by our stockholders are \nimportant to the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intend to consider the results of this vote in making  \nfuture NEO compensation decisions.\nRecommendation of the Board\nThe Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:\n\u201cRESOLVED, that the Fiscal 2024 compensation paid to the Company\u2019s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant \nto Item\u00a0402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative \ndiscussion, is hereby APPROVED.\u201d\n42",
  "Executive Compensation\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nThis CD&A describes our Fiscal 2024 executive compensation philosophy, design, and process, and how our corporate \nresults affected the payout of performance-based awards.  Our Fiscal 2024 NEOs were:\nJen-Hsun Huang\nColette M. Kress\nAjay K. Puri\nDebora Shoquist\nTimothy S. Teter\nPresident and CEO\nEVP and CFO\nEVP, Worldwide \nField Operations\nEVP, Operations\nEVP, General Counsel \nand Secretary\nFiscal 2024 Executive Compensation Summary\nContinued Focus on Pay for Performance \nNVIDIA\u2019s executive compensation program in Fiscal 2024 continued to be guided by a pay for performance philosophy to \nlink competitive NEO pay with our stockholders\u2019 interests.  Approximately 96% of our CEO\u2019s, and approximately 56% of \nour other NEOs\u2019, total target pay was dependent on corporate performance in the form of SY PSUs, MY PSUs, and \nvariable cash. \nExecutive Pay Heavily Weighted Towards Equity Awards\nThe vast majority of our NEOs\u2019 total target pay for Fiscal 2024 was comprised of equity awards:\n\u2022\nSY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income performance (with an opportunity to earn Additional SY \nPSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Gross Margin performance), vesting over 4 years\n\u2022\nMY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, vesting over 3 years, and\n\u2022\nRSUs vesting over 4 years (for NEOs other than our CEO)\n(1) Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of annual base salary, and, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals at \na Base Compensation Plan level, target payout opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan and target equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver.  The \ntarget equity opportunity for SY PSUs does not include the Additional SY PSUs.  \n(2) Reflects the total target pay mix average for each NEO other than our CEO.  The total does not sum to 100% due to rounding.  \nNEOs were also eligible for variable cash awards based on annual revenue performance, in addition to base salary.\nAdditional SY PSU Opportunities and Lower Threshold Payout; No Changes to Total Target Pay Amounts\nThe CC designed Fiscal 2024 NEO total target pay to be flat with Fiscal 2023, but adjusted certain features of the \ncompensation program to motivate our executives while emphasizing the Company\u2019s long-term strategy.  Up to an \nadditional 50% of an NEO\u2019s target SY PSU payout, or the Additional SY PSUs, could be earned upon achievement of a \nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin goal, if we achieved Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income at or above Base \nCompensation Plan.  For SY PSUs and our Variable Cash Plan, Base Compensation Plan goals approximated, while Stretch \nCompensation Plan goals were set well above, our Fiscal 2023 results, and payouts for Threshold performance were \nreduced to 20% in Fiscal 2024 from 50% in Fiscal 2023.  Because the Additional SY PSUs represented an upside payout \n43",
  "opportunity, the CC set both the Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin Threshold and the Stretch Compensation Plan \ngoals well above actual Fiscal 2023 performance.\nRecord Performance Resulting in Maximum Payouts\nFiscal 2024 Revenue\nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP \nOperating Income (1)\nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP \nGross Margin (1)\n3-Year TSR Relative to S&P 500 \n(Fiscal 2022 to 2024) (2)\n$60.9 billion\n$37.1 billion\n73.8%\n276% (99th Percentile of S&P 500)\n(1)    See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.\n(2)   Represents TSR for purposes of the MY PSU performance goal, calculated using cumulative stock price appreciation with dividends reinvested and the \naverage closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period.\nAs a result of the above performance achievements, each exceeding the CC\u2019s pre-established Stretch Compensation Plan \ngoals, our NEOs earned the maximum payouts possible for our Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs (including the Additional SY \nPSUs), and MY PSUs.\nOur Compensation Philosophy and Practices\nNVIDIA is building a one-of-a-kind company that invents the future, builds amazing technologies, and strives to achieve \nthe highest level of craft.  To achieve this vision, we must attract and retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing \nour stockholders\u2019 interests.  While our CC considers numerous factors in making executive pay decisions, our \ncompensation program is guided by the following philosophies:\n\u2022\nPay for Performance: emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiple \ncorporate metrics\n\u2022\nProvide Competitive Pay: NEO target compensation should be competitive with our peers, reflect job impact, \nscope, and responsibilities, and be structured to attract and retain talent\n\u2022\nStockholder Alignment: align NEO pay with stockholders\u2019 long-term interests and consider feedback from our \nannual stockholder engagement efforts and \u201csay-on-pay\u201d vote\n\u2022\nSimplicity and Transparency: design a compensation program with simple, objective metrics\nIn this CD&A, total target pay refers to (i) an NEO\u2019s annual base salary, (ii) target variable cash opportunity, which means \nthe potential payout under our Variable Cash Plan, assuming the Company achieves the associated performance goal at a \nBase Compensation Plan level, and (iii) target equity opportunity, which means the value of the equity opportunities \ngranted during the year that the CC intended to deliver, assuming that the Company achieves associated performance \ngoals at a Base Compensation Plan level (and for purposes of the SY PSUs, excluding the Additional SY PSUs).\nOur executive compensation program adheres to the following practices: \nWhat We Do\nWhat We Don\u2019t Do\n\u00fcEmphasize at-risk, performance-based compensation, \nwith simple, objective goals for those components of pay\n\u00fcInclude multi-year PSU awards\n\u00fcUse annual and 3-year performance targets to \ndetermine PSU awards earned\n\u00fcSet rigorous performance goals that are informed by the \nCompany\u2019s operating plan\n\u00fcRequire NEOs to provide continuous service for 4 years \nto fully vest in SY PSU and RSU awards\n\u00fcEvaluate our program annually based on feedback from \nstockholder engagement efforts and make adjustments \nwhen appropriate\n\u00fcMitigate compensation risks\n\u00fcCap performance-based variable cash and PSU payouts\n\u00fcRetain an independent compensation consultant \nreporting directly to the CC\n\u00fcRequire NEOs to maintain meaningful stock ownership\n\u00fcMaintain a clawback policy for performance-based \ncompensation\nX Enter into agreements with NEOs providing for specific \nterms of employment or severance benefits\nX Give our executive officers special change-in-control \nbenefits\nX Provide automatic equity vesting upon a change-in-\ncontrol (except for the provisions in our equity plans that \napply to all employees if an acquiring company does not \nassume or substitute our outstanding stock awards)\nX Give NEOs supplemental retirement benefits\nX Provide tax gross-ups\nX Pay dividends or the equivalent on unearned or \nunvested equity\nX Permit executive officers, employees, or directors to \nhedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock or to pledge \nNVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan\n44",
  "How We Determine Executive Compensation\nThe CC\u2019s oversight and decision-making for our Fiscal 2024 executive compensation program is a multi-year process:\nDec 2022 - Feb \n2023\nJan 2023\nMar 2023\nMar 2024\nMay 2024\nMembers of \nmanagement and the \nBoard, including our \nLead Director and a \nCC member, engaged \nin stockholder \noutreach\nCC determined peer \ncompanies\nCC considered \nstockholder feedback \nand peer companies \nin determining \nperformance goals \nand compensation\nCC certified \nachievement and \npayouts for Fiscal \n2024 Variable Cash \nPlan, SY PSUs \ngranted in Fiscal 2024 \nand MY PSUs granted \nin Fiscal 2022 *\nCompleted \ncompensation risk \nassessment; \npublished executive \ncompensation \nprogram details in \nproxy statement\n*  The CC will certify achievement and payouts for MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2024 by March 2026.\nRoles of the CC, Compensation Consultant, and Management\nThe roles of our CC; our independent compensation consultant, Exequity, which reported directly to our CC; and \nmanagement, including our CEO, CFO, and Human Resources and Legal departments, in setting our Fiscal 2024 NEO \ncompensation program are summarized below.\nDuring Fiscal 2024, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC and with compensation \ncommittees at other technology companies.  Our CC analyzed whether Exequity\u2019s role raised any conflict of interests, \ntaking into consideration the following:  \n\u2022\nExequity does not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we pay Exequity on the CC\u2019s behalf);\n\u2022\nThe percentage of Exequity\u2019s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC\u2019s behalf;\n\u2022\nExequity\u2019s conflict of interest policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nAny business or personal relationship between Exequity and an NEO, or between Exequity\u2019s individual \ncompensation advisors and an NEO or any member of our CC; and \n\u2022\nAny NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or its individual compensation advisors\nAfter considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity\u2019s work did not create any conflict of interests.\nOur CC reviews and approves the compensation of all of our NEOs, and solicits the input of Mr. Huang and Exequity for its \nNEO compensation decisions.  Specifically, at the CC\u2019s direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group \nfor our Fiscal 2024 executive pay program, which was approved by the CC.  Management gathered peer data from the \nRadford Global Technology Survey, or the Radford Survey, which was considered by Exequity in its analysis of Mr. Huang\u2019s \ncompensation, and by Mr. Huang in his recommendations on our other NEOs\u2019 compensation for Fiscal 2024.  The CC \nconsidered Exequity\u2019s advice, Mr. Huang\u2019s recommendations, and management\u2019s proposed Fiscal 2024 performance goals \nas informed by the Company\u2019s operating plan prior to making its final and sole decision on all Fiscal 2024 NEO \ncompensation.  Ultimately, the CC certified compensation payouts for the applicable performance periods that concluded \nat the end of Fiscal 2024 relating to the Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs granted during Fiscal 2024, and MY PSUs granted \nduring Fiscal 2022.  The CC also oversaw the Fiscal 2024 compensation risk analysis prepared by management.\nPeer Companies and Market Compensation Data\nWe believe our peers should be companies that (1) compete with us for executive talent; (2) have established businesses, \nmarket presence, and complexity similar to us; and (3) are generally of similar size to us, as measured by revenue and/or \nmarket capitalization at roughly 0.5-3.5x of ours.  After consultation with management, the CC determined that the \nexisting peer group generally continued to be appropriate for Fiscal 2024, except for removing Intuit Inc., PayPal Holdings, \nInc., and VMware, Inc. due to their respective revenues and market capitalizations falling below our targeted range: \nFiscal 2024 Peer Group\nAdobe Inc. (ADBE)\nOracle Corporation (ORCL)\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)\nQualcomm Incorporated (QCOM)\nBroadcom Limited (AVGO)\nSalesforce, Inc. (CRM)\nCisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO)\nSAP SE (SAP)\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM)\nTexas Instruments Incorporated (TXN)\nIntel Corporation (INTC)\nVisa Inc. (V)\nNetflix, Inc. (NFLX)\nOur CC chose each member of the peer group after considering a combination of the factors described above.  As a \nresult, while some of our compensation peer group members may have been smaller or larger than us in terms of market \ncapitalization or revenue, the CC determined that such companies were still within a reasonable range of sizes compared \n45",
  "to us and should be included in the peer group because we compete with them for talent and because they have \nestablished businesses with complexity similar to ours. \nIn determining our Fiscal 2024 peer group, the CC reviewed our trailing 12-month revenue (as previously reported up \nthrough our third quarter results for Fiscal 2023) and market capitalization as of October 2022, compared to the 75th \npercentile, median, and 25th percentile of our peer group companies, which were as follows:\nRevenue (in billions)\nMarket Capitalization (in billions)\nFiscal 2024 Peer Group 75th Percentile\n$44.17  \n$168.46\nFiscal 2024 Peer Group Median\n$29.58 \n$131.01 \nFiscal 2024 Peer Group 25th Percentile\n$22.17  \n$114.94 \nNVIDIA\n$28.57 \n$335.94 \nOur CC reviews market practices and compensation data from the Radford Survey for peer companies\u2019 comparably \nsituated executives when determining the components of our executive compensation program, as well as total \ncompensation.  We compare the total compensation opportunity for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at the \n25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of peer company data where available, and the CC considers the factors below in \ndetermining NEO compensation opportunities.\nFactors Used in Determining Executive Compensation\nIn addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions.

During the Fall of 2022, in \npreparing for Fiscal 2024 compensation decisions, we contacted our top institutional holders who held approximately 1% \nor more of our stock, with an aggregate ownership of approximately 32% of our common stock outstanding.  Members of \nmanagement and the Board, including our Lead Director and a member of our CC, ultimately discussed executive \ncompensation with representatives of stockholders holding an aggregate of approximately 19% of our common stock.  \nOur stockholders provided positive feedback on our decision not to change Fiscal 2023 executive compensation \nperformance goals mid-year during the macroeconomic challenges that impacted our Fiscal 2023 payouts, and on the \nbalance of our executive pay across both short- and long-term performance metrics.   \nAfter considering their feedback and the say-on-pay approval rate of 93% of our NEOs\u2019 Fiscal 2022 compensation, our CC \ndetermined to maintain generally the same elements and performance-based metrics for our Fiscal 2024 NEO pay \nprogram, but provided for an opportunity to earn Additional SY PSUs upon achievement of a rigorous Non-GAAP Gross \nMargin goal, as further described below.  Our CC believed that continuing to structure the performance-based \ncomponents of our executive pay program solely around NVIDIA\u2019s corporate financial performance goals appropriately \naligned the motivation of management with the interests of our stockholders.  \nIn the Fall of 2023, members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director, again engaged in stockholder \noutreach.  The CC considered the feedback from these meetings, and the results of the say-on-pay vote for Fiscal 2023 \ncompensation, in making decisions regarding the ongoing Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program.\n46",
  "Total Target Compensation Approach\nIn evaluating Fiscal 2024 compensation, our CC reviewed each NEO\u2019s total target pay opportunity and distribution across \ndifferent pay elements.  Our CC compared Mr. Huang\u2019s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target total cash \nopportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay opportunity against chief executives of our peer companies.  \nFor our other NEOs, their respective total target pay was reviewed by Mr. Huang against similarly situated executives of \nour peer companies, where available.  This market reference, along with his evaluation of internal pay equity, individual \nperformance, level of unvested equity and increasing complexity of our executives\u2019 roles, informed Mr. Huang\u2019s \nrecommendations of the other NEOs\u2019 compensation to the CC.  The CC also considered the factors discussed above in \nFactors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and the CC\u2019s compensation objectives for Fiscal 2024.  Our CC did \nnot use a single formula or assign a specific weight to any one factor in determining each NEO\u2019s target pay.  Instead, our \nCC used its business judgment and experience to set total target compensation, mix of cash and equity, and fixed and at-\nrisk pay opportunities for each NEO to achieve our program\u2019s objectives.  When the CC set each element of pay for an \nNEO, it considered the context of the levels of the other pay elements, and the resulting total target pay for such NEO.  \nThe CC established amounts and a structure that it believed would allow our NEOs to realize above-market value from \nequity awards and variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.  \nContinued Emphasis on Long-Term, At-Risk, Performance-Based Equity Awards\nFor Fiscal 2024, the CC decided that the largest portion of NEOs\u2019 total target pay would remain in the form of at-risk \nequity with performance-based vesting.  The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results \nand increases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive \nand retain our NEOs.  The PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits because our NEOs must \nachieve, for PSUs, the predetermined performance goals and, for both PSUs and RSUs, must remain with us for a longer \nterm (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest in the awards.\nThe CC concluded that, given Mr. Huang\u2019s position as CEO, 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-\nbased, tightly aligning his interests with stockholders.  Consistent with its practice in prior years, the CC granted Mr. \nHuang\u2019s target equity opportunity 100% in the form of SY PSUs (which value is aligned with our annual corporate financial \nperformance) and MY PSUs (which value is aligned with our 3-year relative shareholder return), evenly split between both \nforms of PSUs to emphasize both shorter-term and longer-term performance.  For our other NEOs, the CC provided 40% \nof the target equity opportunity in the form of RSUs and 60% of the target equity opportunity in the form of PSUs.  The \nCC determined this mix appropriately balanced an emphasis on performance achievement while still providing a \nmeaningful amount of time-vesting RSUs to encourage retention.\nTo motivate our NEOs to focus on operational efficiencies and providing value-added products, management \nrecommended, and the CC determined that it was appropriate, to provide our executives with an opportunity to earn \nAdditional SY PSUs in Fiscal 2024 if (i) Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income was achieved at or above Base \nCompensation Plan and (ii) we achieved a Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin goal, as further described below under \nPerformance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation.\n47",

We may also provide perquisites to our NEOs from time to time.  For more information \nabout the other compensation and benefits we provide to our NEOs, see Other Compensation and Benefits below.\nSetting Executive Compensation Values\nFor Fiscal 2024, after considering the scope and complexity of management\u2019s roles and responsibilities, the CC \ndetermined that our NEOs\u2019 target pay should be flat with Fiscal 2023.  There were no increases to base salaries or variable \ncash opportunities and no intended increases to target equity opportunities (minor differences in values occurred due to \nrounding in share calculation methodology).  However, the CC did adjust NEOs\u2019 upside opportunity and provided for \nAdditional SY PSUs that could be earned if, assuming annual Non-GAAP Operating Income was achieved at or above Base \nCompensation Plan, an additional Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin goal was achieved. \nDetermining Equity Award Amounts\nTo determine the actual share number of RSUs and target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs awarded to our NEOs, the \nCC divided the target equity opportunities they intended to deliver, as described above, by the 30-calendar day trailing \naverage closing price of our common stock ending on the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of grant, which \nwas used instead of the stock price on the date of grant to smooth the effects of possible market volatility.  The CC \nunderstands that using a historical average stock price can result in the ultimate grant date value of an award as required \nto be reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table under ASC 718 being \ndifferent than the target equity opportunity.  The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and determined \nthe process described above is appropriate.\nThe target number of SY PSUs would be eligible to vest upon the Company\u2019s achievement of Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP \nOperating Income at Base Compensation Plan.  If the Company achieved Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income at \nStretch Compensation Plan or more, excluding the Additional SY PSUs, the maximum number of SY PSUs would be",
  "eligible to vest, capped at 150% of Mr. Huang\u2019s, and 200% of our other NEOs\u2019 respective, SY PSU target equity \nopportunities.  If the Company achieved Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Threshold, the minimum number of \n48",
  "SY PSUs would be eligible to vest, equivalent to 20% of our NEOs\u2019 respective SY PSU target equity opportunities.  In \naddition, upon the Company achieving at least Base Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income, if \nthe Company also achieved Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin at Threshold or better, our NEOs could earn Additional \nSY PSUs capped at 50% of their respective SY PSU target equity opportunities.  \nThe target number of MY PSUs would be eligible to vest upon the Company\u2019s achievement of TSR relative to the S&P 500 \nfrom the start of Fiscal 2022 to the end of Fiscal 2024, or the 3-Year Relative TSR, at Base Compensation Plan.  If the \nCompany achieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Stretch Compensation Plan or more, the maximum number of MY PSUs would \nbe eligible to vest, capped at 150% of Mr. Huang\u2019s, and 200% of our other NEOs\u2019 respective, MY PSU target equity \nopportunities.  If the Company achieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Threshold level, the minimum number of MY PSUs would \nbe eligible to vest, equivalent to 25% of our NEOs\u2019 respective MY PSU target equity opportunities.\nNo PSUs would be eligible to vest if the applicable Threshold performance level was not achieved.  Any PSUs determined \nto be unearned would be cancelled.\nPerformance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation\nThe CC\u2019s decisions in March 2023 regarding the performance metrics for Fiscal 2024 executive compensation were \ninformed by the Fiscal 2024 operating plan as approved by the Board at that time.  The operating plan took into account \nthe Company\u2019s challenging Fiscal 2023, with macroeconomic and market headwinds on our business resulting in our \nrevenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income performance falling short of the CC\u2019s pre-established goals for executive \ncompensation.  The CC intended for the Fiscal 2024 performance goals to be rigorous and uncertain, considered the \nlikelihood of a range of business scenarios that could impact our performance, and acknowledged that sustaining the \nsame level of financial performance achieved during Fiscal 2023 under the then-current business conditions would \nrequire significant effort by our NEOs.  Recognizing an increasingly complex macroeconomic environment, the CC set \nBase Compensation Plan goals close to actual performance for Fiscal 2023, and set Stretch Compensation Plan goals at \nlevels that would require year-over-year growth representing extremely strong financial performance.  In addition, given \nthe uncertain operating environment, the CC determined to provide our NEOs with an opportunity to earn Additional SY \nPSUs and chose Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin as the related performance metric to motivate our NEOs to focus \non operational efficiencies and providing value-added products.  Specifically, assuming Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating \nIncome was achieved at or above Base Compensation Plan, Additional SY PSUs, capped at 50% of each NEO\u2019s SY PSU \ntarget equity opportunity, could be earned if the Company achieved at least a Threshold Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross \nMargin.  Because the Additional SY PSUs represented an upside payout opportunity, the CC set both the Fiscal 2024 Non-\nGAAP Gross Margin Threshold and the Stretch Compensation Plan goals, well above actual Fiscal 2023 performance.  \nFiscal 2024 performance metrics and goals for NEO pay were as set forth below:  \nPERFORMANCE METRICS\nVariable Cash Plan\nSY PSUs\nMY PSUs\nMetric\nRevenue\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and for \nAdditional SY PSUs only, Non-GAAP \nGross Margin\nTSR relative to the S&P 500\nTimeframe\n1 year\n1 year\n3 years\nCC\u2019s Rationale for Metric\nDrives value, contributes \nto Company\u2019s long-term \nsuccess\nFocuses on growth in \nnew and existing \nmarkets\nDistinct, separate metric \nfrom Non-GAAP \nOperating Income\nDrives value, contributes to Company\u2019s \nlong-term success \nNon-GAAP Operating Income reflects our \nannual revenue generation and effective \noperating expense management \nNon-GAAP Gross Margin emphasizes \nprofitability in critical market platforms  \nDistinct, separate metrics from revenue\nAligns directly with long-term \nshareholder value creation\nProvides comparison of our stock price \nperformance, including dividends, \nagainst a capital market index in which \nwe compete\nRelative performance goal accounts for \nmacroeconomic factors impacting the \nmarket\nPERFORMANCE GOALS\nVariable Cash Plan\nSY PSUs\nMY PSUs\nFiscal 2024 \nRevenue\nPayout as a \n% of Target \nOpportunity \n(1)\nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP \nOperating Income (2)\nShares Eligible to Vest as a % \nof Target Opportunity (1)\nFiscal 2022 \nto 2024    \n3-Year \nRelative TSR \n(3)\nShares \nEligible to \nVest as a % of \nTarget \nOpportunity \n(1)\nThreshold\n$20.0 billion\n20%\n$4.6  billion\n20%\n25th \npercentile\n25%\nBase Compensation \nPlan \n$26.0 billion\n100%\n$9.4 billion\n100%\n50th \npercentile\n100%\nStretch \nCompensation Plan\n$29.5 billion\n200%\n$11.9 billion\nCEO 150% \nOther NEOs 200%\nAdditional 50% possible for \nall NEOs (4)\n75th \npercentile\nCEO 150% \nOther NEOs \n200%\n49",

MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2024 cover the Fiscal \n2024 to Fiscal 2026 performance period and consist of the same performance goal structure and payout opportunities.\n(4)\nUpon the Company achieving at least Base Compensation Plan for Fiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Operating Income, (i) if the Company also achieves Fiscal \n2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin between Threshold of 66.5% and Stretch Compensation Plan of 68.5%, the number of eligible Additional SY PSUs will be \nequal to an amount linearly interpolated between 0% and 50% of the SY PSU target opportunities for each NEO, and (ii) if the Company also achieves \nFiscal 2024 Non-GAAP Gross Margin of 68.5% or more, the number of eligible Additional SY PSUs will be capped at 50% of the SY PSU target \nopportunities for each NEO. \nEach of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives:  \n\u2022\nThreshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create value; represented an appropriately decelerated \npayout for performance below Base Compensation Plan.  For Additional SY PSUs, Threshold was uncertain but \nattainable with significant effort and execution success, as it represented an upside payout opportunity\n\u2022\nBase Compensation Plan was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution success; included \nbudgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth considering macroeconomic conditions and \nreasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing and new businesses\n\u2022\nStretch Compensation Plan required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong market factors and a very \nhigh level of management execution and corporate performance\nFiscal 2024 Performance Achievement\nAs a result of record performance on the strength of our Data Center market platform, and generative AI and accelerated \ncomputing driving significant upside in demand for our products, each of revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-\nGAAP Gross Margin for Fiscal 2024 exceeded their respective Stretch Compensation Plan goals, as did our Fiscal 2022 to \nFiscal 2024 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.  \nIn March 2024, the CC certified the Company\u2019s performance achievement with the following payouts:\nPERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTS\nVariable Cash Plan\nSY PSUs\nMY PSUs (1)\nPerformance \nAchievement for Period \nEnded Fiscal 2024 (2)\n$60.9 billion revenue\n$37.1 billion Non-GAAP \nOperating Income (3)\nFor Additional SY PSUs only, \n73.8% Non-GAAP Gross Margin (3)\n3-year TSR of 276%\n99th percentile relative to S&P \n500\nPayout as % of Target \nOpportunity\n200%\nWith Additional SY PSUs, CEO 200% \nOther NEOs 250% (4)\nCEO 150% \nOther NEOs 200% (5)\n(1)\nRepresents performance achievement and payout of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2022, with a performance period measured from the start of Fiscal \n2022 to the end of Fiscal 2024.\n(2)\nRevenue is GAAP revenue, as the Company reports in its SEC filings.

Non-GAAP Gross Margin is GAAP gross margin, as the Company reports in its SEC filings, \nexcluding acquisition-related and other costs, stock-based compensation expense, and IP-related costs. Consistent with prior years, 3-year TSR for \npurposes of the MY PSUs represents cumulative stock price appreciation, with dividends reinvested, and is measured based on the average closing \nstock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period.

  "Additional Executive Compensation Practices, Policies, and Procedures \nOther Compensation and Benefits\nDue to the high profile of our CEO, and in accordance with the independently-assessed executive security program \nestablished by our Board, NVIDIA provides Mr. Huang with security protection.  In Fiscal 2024, Mr. Huang\u2019s security \narrangements included (i) residential security and consultation fees, (ii) security monitoring services, and (iii) car and driver \nservices.  Mr. Huang\u2019s Fiscal 2024 security costs increased compared to Fiscal 2023, which had covered only a partial year \nof residential security and limited travel.   \nWe do not consider these additional security arrangements to be a personal benefit to Mr. Huang because they arise \nfrom the nature of his employment responsibilities and the related costs have been incurred as required by the Board\u2019s \nexecutive security program.  However, the aggregate incremental costs to NVIDIA of providing personal security \narrangements for Mr. Huang have been reported in the \u201cAll Other Compensation\u201d column of the Summary Compensation \nTable below.   \nWe believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of NVIDIA and \nits stockholders, as they enable Mr. Huang to focus on his duties to the Company while reducing security threats, and \ntherefore, mitigate risks to our business.  The CC has implemented an annual process to provide oversight of the nature \nand cost of executive security measures.  In evaluating potential perquisites, we consider many factors, including the cost \nto the Company relative to the anticipated benefit to our business, perceived value to our executives, comparative data \nfrom our peers, as well as other corporate governance and employee relations factors.\nWe also provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance, matches for health savings account \ncontributions, as well as time off and paid holidays, for our NEOs on the same basis as our other employees.  Like other \nemployees, our NEOs are eligible to participate in our ESPP, unless otherwise prohibited by the rules of the Internal \nRevenue Service, and our 401(k) plan, which included a Company match of salary deferral contributions of up to $9,000 \nfor calendar 2023 and up to $11,500 for calendar 2024.  For Fiscal 2024 (which consisted of most of calendar year 2023 \nand a portion of calendar year 2024), each NEO received a 401(k) match in the amount of $9,000.  We believe these \nbenefits are consistent with benefits provided by companies with which we compete for executive-level talent.  We do \nnot provide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs.\nEquity Grant Timing Practices\nThe CC approves all equity award grants to our NEOs on or before the grant date.  The CC\u2019s general practice is to \ncomplete its annual executive compensation review and determine performance goals and target compensation for our \nNEOs, and then equity awards are granted to NEOs and become effective.  This process is further described in How We \nDetermine Executive Compensation above.  Accordingly, annual equity awards are typically granted to our NEOs in March.  \nOn occasion, the CC may grant equity awards outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, \nretention or other purposes.  While the CC has discretionary authority to approve equity awards to our NEOs outside of \nthe cycle described above, the CC does not have a practice or policy of granting equity awards in anticipation of the \nrelease of material nonpublic information and, in any event, we do not time the release of material non-public information \nin coordination with grants of equity awards in a manner that intentionally benefits our NEOs.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board believes that executive officers should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance \nPolicies require the CEO to hold shares of our common stock valued at six times his base salary, and our other NEOs to \nhold shares of our common stock valued at the NEO\u2019s respective base salary.  Shares that count toward the ownership \nguidelines include shares held by the NEO, shares held in trust for the NEO and his/her immediate family, and vested but \ndeferred shares, but not unvested or unexercised equity awards.  NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach \nthe ownership threshold.  The stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align NEO interests with stockholder \ninterests.  Each NEO currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements. \nCompensation Recovery Policy\nWe have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009 and amended it in November 2023 to comply with \nNasdaq\u2019s listing standards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation provided to \ncurrent or former executive officers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if such",
  "compensation exceeds the amount that the executive officers would have received based on the restated financial \nstatements, subject to limited exceptions. \nTax and Accounting Implications\nUnder Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company\u2019s \u201ccovered employees\u201d that exceeds $1 million per \ntaxable year is generally non-deductible, excluding certain performance-based compensation that qualifies for an \nexception pursuant to the transition relief provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  \n53",
  "The CC looks at a variety of factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide compensation for the \nNEOs in a manner consistent with the goals of the Company\u2019s executive compensation program and the best interests of \nthe Company and its stockholders, which may include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the Company \ndue to the deduction limit under Section 162(m).  The CC also retains the flexibility to modify compensation that was \ninitially intended to be exempt from the deduction limit under Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are \nconsistent with the Company\u2019s business needs.\nOur CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and in general, our executive plans and \nprograms are designed to comply with the requirements of that section to avoid the possible adverse tax consequences \nthat may arise from non-compliance.\nUnder ASC 718, the Company is required to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over \nthe vesting period of the award.  We record share-based compensation expense on an ongoing basis according to ASC \n718.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nA reconciliation between our GAAP gross margin and Non-GAAP gross margin is as follows (in millions): \nFiscal 2024\nGAAP gross profit\n$44,301\nGAAP gross margin \n 72.7 %\n     Acquisition-related and other costs \n477\n     Stock-based compensation expense\n141\n     IP-related costs \n40\nNon-GAAP gross profit\n44,959\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin \n 73.8 %\nA reconciliation between our GAAP operating income and Non-GAAP operating income is as follows (in millions):\nFiscal 2024\nFiscal 2023\nGAAP operating income\n$32,972\n$4,224\nStock-based compensation expense\n3,549\n2,710\nAcquisition-related and other costs\n583\n674\nIP-related and legal settlement costs\n40\n23\nRestructuring costs and other\n\u2014\n54\nAcquisition termination cost\n\u2014 \n1,353\nOther\n(10)\n2\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\n$37,134\n$9,040\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance stockholders\u2019 overall understanding of our historical financial \nperformance.  The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as a \nsubstitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP financial measures may be \ndifferent from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. \n54",
  "Risk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans\nCompany management performed an assessment of the Company\u2019s compensation programs and policies for Fiscal 2024 \nwith the oversight of the CC, as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risks that may \nbe created by our compensation programs.  The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout and the \nability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout\u2014specifically, the \nCompany\u2019s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identified \nthe key terms of these programs, potential risks they may present, and specific risk mitigation features.\nThe CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, \nwhich are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks \nwhich are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  \nThe CC believes that the following compensation design features mitigate against risk: \n\u00fc\nOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-\nterm goals, and balances incentives by using a mix of base salary and variable pay\n\u00fc\nWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on \nachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout\n\u00fc\nWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which are used to measure and \ndetermine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs\n\u00fc\nFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs, and Additional SY PSUs are \napproved by the CC and informed by the annual financial plan approved by the Board each year\n\u00fc\nMY PSUs are designed with a relative goal\n\u00fc\nWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to executive officers that requires NVIDIA to recover \ncertain incentive compensation paid in connection with certain accounting restatements\n\u00fc\nThe CC monitors burn rate and overhang\n\u00fc\nAll executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting\n\u00fc\nWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive \nofficers\u2019 interests with those of our stockholders\n\u00fc\nOur insider trading policy prohibits hedging, pledging, using margin accounts, and trading in derivatives \ninvolving our common stock which prevents our employees from insulating themselves from the effects of \nNVIDIA stock price performance\n55",

As a result, the pay ratio reported by \nother companies may not be comparable to ours. \nPay Versus Performance\nNVIDIA\u2019s executive compensation program is guided by a pay for performance philosophy and is designed to align NEO \npay with our stockholders\u2019 interests.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our NEOs\u2019 total compensation is based on the \nCompany\u2019s performance under certain corporate financial metric goals, which for Fiscal 2024 included annual revenue, \nannual Non-GAAP Operating Income, annual Non-GAAP Gross Margin, and 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500.  \nAmounts set forth below as \u201ccompensation actually paid,\u201d or CAP, have been calculated in accordance with Item 402(v) of \nRegulation S-K under the Securities Act, and do not represent the value of compensation actually paid to or received by \nour NEOs.  For a discussion of our executive compensation program and philosophy, refer to our CD&A above.\nThe following table summarizes information regarding compensation for our NEOs, including CAP as well as certain \nfinancial performance metrics, during Fiscal 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021.

The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other \nservices provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the \naccounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the \nindependent registered public accounting firm.\nManagement is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control \nover financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable \nlaws and regulations.

This proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2024 Meeting if properly presented. Our Board \nhas elected not to make a voting recommendation with respect to this proposal.\nJohn Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, the beneficial owner of at least 10 shares \nof our common stock on the date the proposal was submitted, intends to present the following proposal at the 2024 \nMeeting.\nProposal 4 \u2013 Simple Majority Vote\nShareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws \n(that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be replaced by a \nrequirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with \napplicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such \nproposals consistent with applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English.\nShareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance. \nSupermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related \nto company performance according to \u201cWhat Matters in Corporate Governance\u201d by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and \nAllen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most \nshareowners but opposed by a status quo management.\nThis proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs, \nFirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy\u2019s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholders had \naccess to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each at the 2023 \nannual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG).\nThe overwhelming shareholder support for this proposal topic at hundreds of major companies raises the question of why \nNVIDIA had not initiated this proposal topic on its own.\nPlease vote yes:\nSimple Majority Vote \u2013 Proposal 4\n68",
  "Board Statement in Response to Proposal 4\nProposal 4 is advisory only, and our Board does not recommend a vote either for or against the proposal.  Approval of \nProposal 4 would not, by itself, implement a majority voting standard.  Our Board and our stockholders would need to take \nsubsequent action to replace each supermajority voting standard in our Charter and Bylaws with a voting standard \nrequiring only a simple majority of the votes cast, or the Simple Majority Vote, or as close as permitted by Delaware law.\nCurrently, our Charter and Bylaws specify supermajority voting standards applicable only to certain fundamental changes \nin corporate governance. The only provisions in our Charter and Bylaws that require the affirmative vote of the holders of \nat least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of stock of \nNVIDIA, entitled to vote at an election of directors, or the Supermajority Voting Requirement, are:\nCharter\nBylaws\n\u2022\nAlteration, amendment or repeal of any of the following Charter provisions \n(Article VII, paragraph B):\n\u2022\nRemoval of director without cause (Section 21)  \n\u25e6\nComposition and election of the Board, amendment of the Bylaws, and \nstockholder action by written consent (Article V) \n\u2022\nAdoption, amendment, or repeal of the Bylaws by \nstockholders of NVIDIA (Section 48) \n\u25e6\nExculpation for violations of the duty of care by directors (Article VI)\n\u25e6\nAmendment of the Charter (Article VII) \n\u2022\nRemoval of director without cause (Article V, paragraph A(3)) \n\u2022\nAlteration or amendment of a Bylaw provision or the adoption of a new Bylaw \nprovision by stockholders of NVIDIA (Article V, paragraph B(1)) \nIn addition, our Bylaws provide that the default stockholder voting standard for all matters other than the election of \ndirectors is the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote on \nsuch matter, which requires greater than a Simple Majority Vote.\nThe Supermajority Voting Requirement was implemented to ensure broad support for certain fundamental changes to \nour corporate governance affecting all our stockholders. Our Board regularly reviews our governing documents and \nengages with and actively considers feedback from our stockholders concerning possible updates to ensure that the \ninterests of all stockholders are fully protected. Under the proposed Simple Majority Vote standard, a few large \nstockholders could approve certain key actions and significantly alter our governance structure. For example, in the event \nof a stockholder meeting in which only 50% plus one share of our outstanding shares of capital stock are present and \nentitled to vote (the minimum number to constitute a quorum), holders of a majority of the votes cast, which could be \neven less than a majority of the shares present, could approve bylaw amendments that could effect fundamental \nchanges to our corporate governance. Such a circumstance would be avoided by maintaining the current, limited \nSupermajority Voting Requirement.\nUnder the proposed Simple Majority Vote, as required by Delaware law, matters such as removal of directors and \namendment of the Charter would require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of \nall of the then-outstanding shares of stock of NVIDIA. \nOur Board is interested in considering the viewpoints of all of our stockholders and will evaluate the voting results of \nProposal 4, together with additional input received in the course of our regular stockholder engagement program. \nAccordingly, our Board is not making a voting recommendation with respect to Proposal 4.\n69",

  "Part I\nItem 1. Business\nOur Company\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA is now a \nfull-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model that runs on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of \ndomain-specific software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. \nThis deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated \ncomputing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and inference, data \nanalytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from \nhealthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands \nof GPU-accelerated servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture \nand scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern AI applications.\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it \nalso simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing \ncapabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in \nwhich software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of \nenterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional \ncoding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content such as text, code, images, audio, video, and \nmolecule structures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products, \nservices, media or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user preferences.\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to \ncreate unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we \naddress them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and networking and software stacks. The \nprogrammable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same \nunderlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and \npartners. The large and growing number of developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our \necosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $45.3 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding \ninventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC \ngaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we \nopened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way \nfor the emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet \ncomputer image recognition competition, marking the \u201cBig Bang\u201d moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU \nin 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, in \n2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking and led to the \nintroduction of a new processor class \u2013 the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the past 5 years, we have built full software \nstacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the world\u2019s largest industries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack \nfor autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial digitalization; and introduced the NVIDIA AI \nEnterprise software \u2013 essentially an operating system for enterprise AI applications. In 2023, we introduced our first data \ncenter CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high-performance computing. With a strong engineering culture, we drive \nfast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations in all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, \nnetworking, software and algorithms. More than half of our engineers work on software.\nThe world\u2019s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale",
  "accelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end users, \nincluding AI solutions and assistants, search, recommendations, social networking, online shopping, live video, and \ntranslation.\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new \ngenerative AI-enabled products and services, or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their workloads and \nworkflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants and chatbots; the transportation industry \nfor autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug discovery; and the financial \nservices industry for customer support and fraud detection.\n4",

Our AI technology \nleadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing platforms are available \nfrom virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers. There are over 4.7 million \ndevelopers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We \nevangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands of startups through our Inception \nprogram. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, \nand deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform. \nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused \nwith AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development \nresources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and \ncreate new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming, design, and \ncreative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an optimized experience on our \nGeForce and NVIDIA RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-end, from the developer tools",
  "and cloud services to the Tensor Cores included in all RTX-class GPUs. For example, NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, is \na suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI, running in the cloud or locally \non the PC. GeForce Experience enhances each gamer\u2019s experience by optimizing their PC\u2019s settings, as well as enabling \nthe recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of popular creative \napplications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software that empowers artists, \ndesigners, and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also enable interactive graphics \napplications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost \nanywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming. \nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and electric \nvehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing the transportation industry. The algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as \nperception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will use multiple neural \nnetworks instead. In addition, EV makers are looking for next-generation centralized car computers that integrate a wide \nrange of intelligent functions into a single AI compute platform. Therefore, we provide an AI-based hardware and \nsoftware solution, designed and implemented from the ground up based on automotive safety standards, for the AV and \nEV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive OEMs, \n7",
  "tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural \nnetworks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software \nupdates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry \nto solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers \nand partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their \nown products or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further \nenhance the reach of our technology.\nSales and Marketing\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-\nperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global \nmarkets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner \nnetwork incorporates global, regional and specialized CSPs, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, independent software \nvendors, or ISVs, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive \nsuppliers, and other ecosystem participants.\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of \napplication engineers and solution architects to provide pre-sales assistance to our partner network in designing, testing, \nand qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. For example, our solution architects work with CSPs to \nprovide pre-sales assistance to optimize their hardware and software infrastructure for generative AI and LLM training \nand deployment. They also work with foundation model and enterprise software developers to optimize the training and \nfine-tuning of their models and services, and with enterprise end-users, often in collaboration with their global system \nintegrator of choice, to fine-tune models and build AI applications. We believe that the depth and quality of our design \nsupport are key to improving our partner network\u2019s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and \nfostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our \nproducts within each platform.\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and \nmaintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage \nwith key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product \nrequirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program supports the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, \nand APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute \nprovides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and \naccelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\nSeasonality\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and \nautomotive. Our desktop gaming products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Historical \nseasonality trends may not repeat.\nManufacturing \nWe utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for all \nphases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the expertise \nof industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as \nfabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the \nsignificant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly \nprocure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of \ncomponents, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the production of our products. \nAs a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods \nof growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical \nlead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term",
  "manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific \nregion. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung \nElectronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from Micron Technology, \nInc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with \nindependent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron \nCorporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.\n8",
  "Competition \nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving \nindustry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product \nofferings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry \nstandard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain \ncompetitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will \ndemand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at \ncompetitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with \nproducts that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by \nour products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire \nsignificant market share.\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, \nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some of \nour competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be \nmore able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the \nfuture.\nOur current competitors include:\n\u2022\nsuppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other \naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or \nAMD, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n\u2022\nlarge cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate \naccelerated or AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, \nAlphabet Inc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their \ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\n\u2022\nsuppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles, \nautonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, \nQualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams \ndesigning SoC products for their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\n\u2022\nnetworking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including \noptical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard \nEnterprise Company, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group as well as internal teams \nof system vendors and large cloud services companies.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure \nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued \npatents have expiration dates from February 2024 to August 2043. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and \npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to \nour products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, \norganizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may \nbe manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent \nas the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and \nproducts more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for innovations and \ntechnologies based on such factors as:\n\u2022\nthe location in which our products are manufactured;\n\u2022\nour strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\nthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and \nregions.\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\n9",
  "Government Regulations\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of \nforeign governments.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, \nwith certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 \nintegrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products \ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth \nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi \nArabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance \nthresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the \nexport of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent \nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing \nrequirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the \nlong term, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and \nrising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further \nsubject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our \nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and \nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from \nall or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-\nPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative \nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to \nRegulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\u201d for a discussion of this potential impact.\nCompliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, \nresults of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for \nenvironmental control facilities. Compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited \nto, those pertaining to IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, \nbusiness acquisitions, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, \ncompetition and antitrust, advertising, employment, product regulations, cybersecurity, environmental, health and safety \nrequirements, the responsible use of AI, climate change, cryptocurrency, and consumer laws, could increase our costs, \nimpact our competitive position, and otherwise may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition \nand results of operations in subsequent periods.

We assess our programs annually in \nconsideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are \nimportant for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. \nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and \npractices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained \non our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file",
  "with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of risks and \nuncertainties we face related to sustainability.\nClimate Change\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and assess risks, \nincluding current and emerging regulations and market impacts. \nIn May 2023, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 metrics are \nexpected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2025. There has been no material impact to our capital \nexpenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental sustainability \nregulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. By the end of fiscal year 2025, our goal is to purchase \n10",
  "or generate enough renewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for our offices and data centers. In \nfiscal year 2023, we increased the percentage of our total electricity use matched by renewable energy purchases to 44%. \nBy fiscal year 2026, we aim to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA\u2019s scope 3 category 1 \nGHG emissions with goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance \nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it is \noptimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. The energy efficiency of our products is \nevidenced by our continued strong presence on the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient systems. We powered 24 \nof the top 30 most energy efficient systems, including the top supercomputer, on the Green500 list. \nWe plan to build Earth-2, a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. Earth-2 will enable \nscientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of climate change and \nexplore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our \nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had approximately 29,600 employees in 36 countries, 22,200 were \nengaged in research and development and 7,400 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative \npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies \nrelating to human capital management.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented \nemployees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff. \nRecruitment\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be competitive, we have grown our technical workforce and have \nbeen successful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent globally through our strong employer brand \nand differentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 83% technical and \n49% hold advanced degrees. Additionally, we have increased focus on diversity recruiting, resulting in an increase in global \nfemale hiring in each channel. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 40% of our new hires in fiscal year \n2024 coming from employee referrals. \nDevelopment and Retention\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted \ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We have a library of live and on-demand \nlearning experiences that include workshops, panel discussions, and speaker forums. We create learning paths focused \non our most common development needs and constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure that our employees are \nexposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize \neducational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one \nguidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and \ndevelopment programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread \nreadiness for future advancement.\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party \nplatform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we \ncan take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts \nabout making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the \nidentity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.\nWe want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and \nstay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall turnover rate was 2.7%.\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company\u2019s \nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock \nprice and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.",
  "We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees\u2019 and their families\u2019 physical health, well-being, and financial \nhealth. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our \nemployee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies to address mental health, stress, and time-\nmanagement challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the \nregions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community \nResource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents. \n11",
  "Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing team of \nworld-class talent and their families.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all \nemployees.\nWhen recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that \nincludes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino \ncandidates.\nTo this end, we have been:\n\u2022\nPartnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities; \n\u2022\nEmbedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the \ninterview process and find internal opportunities;\n\u2022\nSupporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future \nleaders; \n\u2022\nProviding peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\n\u2022\nProviding training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for \ndiversity;\n\u2022\nTrack equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\n\u2022\nMeasuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts. \nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our \nworkforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\nFlexible Working Environment\nWe support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under \ncertain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes \nNVIDIA a great place to work.\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days off a \nquarter for employees to rest and recharge.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages, and positions as of February\u00a016, \n2024:\nName\nAge\nPosition\nJen-Hsun Huang\n60\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nColette M.

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or \nif they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may \ninvolve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers \nwill demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future \ndesign wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will \nprovide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be \nharmed.\nWe have begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services directly and through our network of partners, \nwhich include cloud-based infrastructure, software and services for training and deploying AI models, and NVIDIA AI \nFoundations for customizable pretrained AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in \ntheir data centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these \nofferings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services has changed \nand may continue to change, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines. NVIDIA DGX Cloud services \nmay not be successful and will take time, resources, and investment. We also offer or plan to offer standalone software \nsolutions, including NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA DRIVE, and several other software solutions. These \nnew business models or strategies may not be successful, and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or \nservices. We may incur significant costs and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offerings.\nCompetition could adversely impact our market share and financial results.\nOur target markets remain competitive, and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service \nofferings, industry standards, customer needs, new entrants and consolidations. Our competitors\u2019 products, services and \ntechnologies, including those mentioned above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may be cheaper or provide better \nfunctionality or features than ours, which has resulted and may in the future result in lower-than-expected selling prices \nfor our products. Some of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities, and have longer operating histories, \nlarger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, more design wins, and greater financial, \nsales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to acquire market share and/or \nprevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end-user trends, \nmore quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient foundry capacity and scarce input \nmaterials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. Some of our customers have in-house \nexpertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solutions to \nreplace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that compete with our AI cloud \nservice offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the scale necessary to meet our \nbusiness objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand for our products, services and \ntechnologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing\nFailure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.",
  "We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not \nprovided guaranteed wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear \nwithin a quarter or year. If our estimates of customer demand are inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there \ncould be a significant mismatch between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and \nexcess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has significantly harmed our financial results.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered \nand may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient \n15",
  "commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These \nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers \nor components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain \nproducts has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available from third \nparties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor \nindustry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have \npreviously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid \npremiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may \ncontinue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require \nadditional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply \ncommitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our \ncustomers\u2019 future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our \nproducts and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\n\u2022\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\n\u2022\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\n\u2022\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\n\u2022\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient data center capacity and energy for customers to procure;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\n\u2022\nnew or unexpected end-use cases;\n\u2022\nincrease in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;\n\u2022\nbusiness decisions made by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX Cloud \nservices;\n\u2022\nchanges that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe demand for our products; or\n\u2022\ngovernment actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on \ngaming usage.\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering \ncustomer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center \nproducts ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, \nadded new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase \nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity \nand execution risk. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements.  Our purchase commitments \nand obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead \ntimes for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong.  \nWe expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur \ninventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products \nor demand declines.\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in \nthe past. Product transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture \nproducts simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product \nintroduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, \nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence \nto meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the \nchallenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for \nnew products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior \narchitectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced",
  "and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate \n16",
  "transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future \narchitecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial \nresults may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products may result in \nunanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other \ncosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the \ncomplexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or \notherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple \nproduct architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and \nimpact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, \nODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple OEMs, \nODMs, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market conditions and \nchanges in end-user demand for our products, have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to \nproperly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.\nIf we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-\ntime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely \nbasis. Even if we are able to increase supply to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or \nour contract manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand \nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, \nwe could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are \npart of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have \nhad and may have a broader revenue impact.\nIf we overestimate our customers\u2019 future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to \npurchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. \nIn the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we \nhave implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need \nto continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers\u2019 \nincrease in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our \ninventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may have to do so in the future. These impacts \nwere amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our historical \nlead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these \nimpacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are \nexpected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively \nimpact our gross margins and financial results.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX \nCloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for \nnew use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may \nnot be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as \ngenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term \ntrajectory is unknown. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to \nestimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI models on our reported revenue or \nforecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper \nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility \nin our revenue or supply levels.",
  "in our revenue or supply levels.\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional \nbasis. Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or \nother events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant \nportion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to \nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use \ncases, has impacted and can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes \nand drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, \nsuch as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of \ncryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for our products. Volatility in \nthe cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government \ncryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in the method of verifying \nblockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products \nand can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and \nprocesses including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the \nusage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased aftermarket sales of our \n17",
  "GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. In general, our new \nproducts or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized \u201cgray market,\u201d which also makes \ndemand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our new products and \ndistribution channels.\nAdditionally, we depend on developers, customers and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated \ncomputing applications that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make \ntheir content available on our platforms, such as GeForce NOW. Failure by developers, customers, and other third parties \nto build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party content providers or \npublishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our \nplatforms, could adversely affect customer demand.\nDependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products \nreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could \nharm our business.\nWe depend on foundries to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. \nWe do not assemble, test, or package our products, but instead contract with independent subcontractors. These \nsubcontractors assist with procuring components used in our systems, boards, and products. We face several risks which \nhave adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain, \nnegatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross \nmargin, revenue and/or financial results, including:\n\u2022\nlack of guaranteed supply of wafer, component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and \ncomponent prices, from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with \nsufficient quantities or in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nfailure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or provide adequate levels of \nmanufacturing or test capacity for our products;\n\u2022\nfailure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including \ntransitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory \ndesigns needed to manufacture our products;\n\u2022\nfailure by our suppliers to comply with our policies and expectations and emerging regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlimited number and geographic concentration of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly \nand test providers and memory manufacturers;\n\u2022\nloss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or \nsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss, addition or change of a \nsupplier;\n\u2022\nlack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nsuppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products \nwithout our qualification;\n\u2022\ndelays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our \nsubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors\u2019 or other customers\u2019 orders over ours;\n\u2022\nrequirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for \nsupply in advance;\n\u2022\nlow manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry\u2019s proprietary process \ntechnology; and\n\u2022\ndisruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to closures related to heat waves, earthquakes, \nfires, or other natural disasters and electricity conservation efforts.\nDefects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate, which can damage \nour reputation and cause us to lose market share.\nOur hardware and software product and service offerings are complex. They have in the past and may in the future \ncontain defects or security vulnerabilities or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of \nissues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials, bugs and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our \nproducts are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications or as new versions are released. These \nrisks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in our products, as \nthese arrangements reduce our direct control over production. AI software products we or our partners offer rely on \n18",
  "training data that may originate from third parties and new training methods, and the resulting products may contain \nunknown or undetected defects and errors, or reflect unintended bias. Although arrangements with component providers \nmay contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for \nwarranty product defects that may occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the \npast and may in the future be only discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered \nvulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property, or expose our customers to \nunscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products or \nservices. Defects or failure of our offerings to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products \nin which our offerings have been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and automotive manufacturers and tier 1 automotive \nsuppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and \nrepair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the value of related inventory, and divert \nthe attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct \nthe issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in \nnew products, releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure \nto achieve market acceptance, loss of design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market and \nharm to our relationships with existing and prospective customers and partners and consumers\u2019 perceptions of our \nbrand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. We \nmay be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace products in \nthe field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.\nFor example, in fiscal year 2023, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center \nproducts. This defect has had, and other defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of \ncomponents and finished goods. These costs could be significant in future periods. We recorded a net warranty liability \nduring fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for \nwarranty obligations, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our estimate proves to be incorrect. In \ngeneral, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against us, even if the alleged damage is due \nto the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim could be \nsignificant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our \nbusiness liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could \nadversely impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Global Operating Business\nAdverse economic conditions may harm our business.\nEconomic and industry uncertainty or changes, including recession or slowing growth, inflation, changes or uncertainty in \nfiscal, monetary or trade policy, disruptions to capital markets and the banking system, currency fluctuations, higher \ninterest rates, tighter credit, lower capital expenditures by businesses, including on IT infrastructure, increases in \nunemployment, labor shortages, and lower consumer confidence and spending, global supply chain constraints and global \neconomic and geopolitical developments have in the past and/or could in the future have adverse, wide-ranging effects \non our business and financial results, including:\n\u2022\nincreased costs for wafers, components, logistics, and other supply chain expenses, which have negatively \nimpacted our gross margin in the past and may do so in the future;\n\u2022\nincreased supply, employee, facilities and infrastructure costs and volatility in the financial markets, which have \nreduced and may in the future reduce our margins;\n\u2022\ndecrease in demand for our products, services and technologies and those of our customers, partners or \nlicensees;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us and our customers\u2019 or our licensees\u2019 \ninability to supply products to customers and/or end users;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to forecast operating results and make business decisions;\n\u2022\nthe insolvency of key suppliers, distributors, customers, cloud service providers, data center providers, licensing \nparties or other third parties we rely on;\n\u2022",
  "parties or other third parties we rely on;\n\u2022\nreduced profitability of customers, which may cause them to scale back operations, exit businesses, file for \nbankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, or lead to mergers, consolidations or strategic alliances \namong other companies, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively; and\n\u2022\nincreased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced \nliquidity, adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers, failures of counterparties, including financial \ninstitutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments. \n19",
  "Adverse developments affecting financial institutions, such as bank failures or instability, or concerns or speculation \nabout similar events or risks, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and other disruptions, which could impact our \ncustomers\u2019 ability to fulfill their payment obligations to us, our vendors\u2019 ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, \nor our ability to fulfill our own obligations.\nAdditionally, we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are \nsubject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or \nevents that affect global financial markets, as described above. A majority of our investment portfolio comprises USG \nsecurities. A decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual \nor threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, \nreduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in \nour investments or require us to record impairment charges.\nInternational sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our \nbusiness.\nWe sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our \nsemiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United \nStates, and we generated 56% of our revenue in fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States. Our sales to \nChina decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. \nAlthough we have not received licenses from the USG to ship restricted products to China, we have started to ship \nalternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center \nrevenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing requirements and we expect China to be in a similar \nrange in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and \nuncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial \ncondition and results of operations. These include domestic and international economic and political conditions in \ncountries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of \nglobal or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, \ndifferent domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation \npolicies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues and \nother catastrophic events.\nProduct, system security, and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce \nour expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server \nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks \nare becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or \nimplement adequate preventative measures.\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-\nsupported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited \nif our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restoring from backups is delayed or not feasible.\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported \nactors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. Additionally, some \nactors are using AI technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts \nand during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be vulnerable to a heightened \nrisk of cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services and products. We may also face \ncybersecurity threats due to error or intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service \nproviders. Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors and/or other third-\nparty service providers safeguarding our sensitive information and adhering to our security policies and access control",
  "mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure \nto properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms and, although \nno such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat will \nnot result in an incident that is material to us. Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party \nsuppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption \nand authentication technology, employee email and other functions, which exposes us to supply-chain attacks or other \nbusiness disruptions. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partners\u2019 \nsupply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable vulnerabilities, defects or bugs that \ncould result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems, including our products and services, or \nthe third-party information technology systems that support our services. We may also incorporate third-party data into \nour AI algorithms or use open-source datasets to train our algorithms. These datasets may be flawed, insufficient, or \ncontain certain biased information, and may otherwise be vulnerable to security incidents. We may have limited insight \ninto the data privacy or security practices of third-party suppliers, including for our AI algorithms. Our ability to monitor \nthese third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security \nmeasures in place. In addition, if one of our third-party suppliers suffers a security incident (which has happened in the \n20",
  "past and may happen in the future), our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access \nto their systems, logs and other information related to the security incident. Additionally, we are incorporated into the \nsupply chain of a large number of entities worldwide and, as a result, if our products or services are compromised, a \nsignificant number of our customers and their data could be affected, which could result in potential liability and harm \nour business.\nTo defend against security incidents, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and \nreliability features, which is expected to result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop our security \nmeasures, including training programs and security awareness initiatives, designed to ensure our suppliers have \nappropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers, \napplicable industry standards, and government regulations. While we invest in training programs and security awareness \ninitiatives and take steps to detect and remediate certain vulnerabilities that we have identified, we may not always be \nable to prevent threats or detect and mitigate all vulnerabilities in our security controls, systems or software, including \nthird-party software we have installed, as such threats and techniques change frequently and may not be detected until \nafter a security incident has occurred. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures \ndesigned to address identified vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could result in reputational and financial harm, and if \nexploited, these vulnerabilities could result in a security incident.\nWe hold confidential, sensitive, personal and proprietary information, including information from partners and customers. \nBreaches of our security measures, along with reported or perceived vulnerabilities or unapproved dissemination of \nproprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or third parties, could expose us and the parties \naffected to a risk of loss, or misuse of this information, potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability, \nregulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm, including financial, to our business. For \nexample, we hold proprietary game source code from third-party partners in our GFN service. Breaches of our GFN \nsecurity measures, which have happened in the past, could expose our partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this source \ncode, damage both us and our partners, and expose NVIDIA to potential litigation and liability. If we or a third party we rely \non experience a security incident, which has occurred in the past, or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, \nwe may experience adverse consequences, including government enforcement actions, additional reporting requirements \nand/or oversight, restrictions on processing data, litigation, indemnification obligations, reputational harm, diversion of \nfunds, diversion of management attention, financial loss, loss of data, material disruptions in our systems and operations, \nsupply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our goods and services, and other similar harms. Inability to fulfill \norders, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial \nresults, stock price and reputation. Applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant \nstakeholders, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and investors, of security incidents, and mandatory \ndisclosure of such incidents could lead to negative publicity. In addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties \nmay gather, collect or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers or other means that reveals \ncompetitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to harm our business.\nBusiness disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.\nOur worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water \nshortages, telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil \nunrest, acts of war or other military actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or \nman-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center \ncapacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business \noperations, finished goods inventory and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to",
  "natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. \nCatastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT \nand research and development systems and personnel. Our business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not \nbe sufficient for all eventualities. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, \ncan increase economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in \nor around any of the major countries in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of \noperations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and \nTaiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated may \nresult in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and operating \nstrategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have \nrestricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales \nsupport operations and manufacturing, and companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our \noperations could be harmed and our costs could increase if manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for \nany reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power shortages, information technology \nsystem failures or cyber-attacks, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political \nissues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in \ncertain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party \nsystems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in \nexpenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could \nmaterially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n21",
  "We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and \nsafety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, \noperations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include \nexpenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our \nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial \nnumber of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our \nemployees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may \ncause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to \nour business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and \nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\nAdditionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on \nwhich we rely, including due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could \nimpair our ability to provide our products and services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-\nparty systems and services, our exposure to damage from service interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages \nand other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on access to clean water and predictable \nenergy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the ability of our \ncustomers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nClimate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and on our customers, partners and vendors. \nWater and energy availability and reliability in the regions where we conduct business is critical, and certain of our \nfacilities may be vulnerable to the impacts of extreme weather events. Extreme heat and wind coupled with dry \nconditions in Northern California may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk, which can have adverse \nimplications for our Santa Clara, California headquarter offices and data centers, including impairing the ability of our \nemployees to work effectively. Climate change, its impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and its \npotential to increase political instability in regions where we, our customers, partners and our vendors do business, may \ndisrupt our business and cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and costs to maintain or resume operations. \nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks, the types and amounts of \ninsurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost. Some of our policies have large deductibles and broad \nexclusions, and our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim. Losses not covered by insurance may be \nlarge, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and those of our suppliers and customers may also be subject to climate-related laws, regulations and \nlawsuits. New or proposed regulations relating to carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, pollution limits, sustainability-related \ndisclosure and governance and supply chain governance could result in greater direct costs, including costs associated \nwith changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, \nincreased capital expenditures to improve facilities and equipment, and higher compliance and energy costs to reduce \nemissions, other compliance costs, as well as greater indirect costs resulting from our customers and/or suppliers \nincurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs and restrictions could harm our business and \nresults of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter our operations and product design activities. \nStakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may \nface legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated sustainability-related goals, which could harm our \nreputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such goals. We may also experience contractual \ndisputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased \nlitigation and costs.\nWe also face risks related to business trends that may be influenced by climate change concerns. Our business could be",
  "negatively impacted by concerns around the high absolute energy requirements of our GPUs, despite their much more \nenergy efficient design and operation relative to alternative computing platforms.\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to \nsuccessfully integrate acquired companies, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or \nsell our products.\nWe have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies \nthat we believe will help expand or enhance our strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant \nchallenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and \nultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our \nability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely \ncomplete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to \npursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve \nand make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits \nof the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate \nvalue of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been \n22",
  "harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in publicly traded \ncompanies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we \nhave invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain \nkey business initiatives. These companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many \nof the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not \nalways able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could \nrecognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector \nconcentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face \nadditional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, \nincluding management\u2019s attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of \nan acquisition or strategic investment, if at all; difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or \nrestrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or \ninvestment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company \nin which we are investing or are acquiring.\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and \nretaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of \nacquired assets;\n\u2022\nintegrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n\u2022\nstock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition \nor are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, \nand compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n\u2022\nnegative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target \noperate;\n\u2022\nexposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target\u2019s employees, vendors and customers.\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to \nexperience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, \ndifficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and \ncustomers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our \nresults of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a \nconcentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely \naffected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner \nnetwork. Sales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was \nattributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these channel partners, we are selling multiple \nproducts and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales within our partner \nnetwork, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these \npartners may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their \npurchasing patterns in some other way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers \ncan generally cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our \npartners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may purchase products from our competitors; and",
  "our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products, all of which \nmay alter partners\u2019 or customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. Many of our customers often do not purchase directly from us but \npurchase through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors and other channel partners. One indirect \ncustomer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through \nCustomer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, attributable to the \n23",
  "Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a \nquarter end, the system integrators, distributors and channel partners may have limited ability to increase their credit, \nwhich could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction \nin purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries\u2019 trade restrictions or any difficulties \nin collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\nTo be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives \nand key employees and recruit and develop capable and diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are \nbeyond our control, including our industry\u2019s highly competitive market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation and \nworkforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or \ninterpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for personnel results in \nincreased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of stock price volatility, as we have \nexperienced in the past and may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may \ndecrease. Additionally, we are highly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure \neffective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees \ncould hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and \nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls.\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of \ninternal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation \nand scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design and implement \nupdated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system \nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our \ncontinued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These \nchanges may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. \nFailure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our \noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause \ninvestors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material \nweakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial \nstatements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial \nresults on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our \nstock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are \nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous of these risk factors. \nTherefore, investors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. \nAdditional factors that could affect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\n\u2022\nour extended payment term arrangements with certain customers, the inability of some customers to make \nrequired payments, our ability to obtain credit insurance for customers with extended payment terms, and \ncustomer bad debt write-offs;\n\u2022\nour vendors' payment requirements;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.",
  "\u2022\nchanges in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards.\nAny of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our anticipated financial results. For example, we \nhave granted and may continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic \ndownturns, which could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for \nshorter payment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have \navailable for general business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may \nlag our revenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our \nexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has \nin the past, or experience substantial price volatility.\n24",
  "Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and \npolitical and other actions may adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not \nlimited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including \nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; \ndata privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; \nenvironmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; sustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer \nlaws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position, and may \nnegatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance \nthat our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, \nand procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, \ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to \nour reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, or changes to their interpretation and \nenforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further restrictions on our ability to \nmanufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance costs as \na result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from \nregulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in \nour business from regulators worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and China. \nFor example, the French Competition Authority collected information from us regarding our business and competition in \nthe graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We \nhave also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China \nregarding our sales of GPUs, our efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and our investments, partnerships and \nother agreements with companies developing foundation models, and we expect to receive additional requests for \ninformation in the future. Governments and regulators are considering imposing restrictions on the hardware, software, \nand systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. If implemented, such restrictions could \nincrease the costs and burdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, \nand reduce the number of new entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions \nto laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the \nimposition of or increase to import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory \nactions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, \nchanges in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively \nimpact our business and results of operations.\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign \ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on \nthe activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could \naffect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export \nlicense with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. Entity List or other USG restricted parties lists (which is \nexpected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect \non our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable \nnon-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available \nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial \ncondition.\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and",
  "export control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and \ncertain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. \nConcurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that \ntarget products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions \nimpacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns \nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral \nor multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs. Such \nrestrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users worldwide to \nacquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact our business \nand financial results.\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, \nincluding but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, \nincluding GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by \nstakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral controls restricting GPUs and associated \n25",
  "products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and \nmay again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one \nor more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and \nwarehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and \ncould negatively and materially impact our business, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and \nsemiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would \nfurther restrict our ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to \nsimilar restrictions, creating a competitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial \nresults. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future \nsubject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, \nnegatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide \nservices such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and \ncustomers to provide services to their end customers, even outside China.\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve \ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has \nnegatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer \nalternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to \nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our \nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls \ncould also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral \ncontrols are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and \ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not \nonly impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, \nthat negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets \nworldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and \nefforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox \nacquisition. If the regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such commitments or we have violated any applicable \nlaw in China, we could be subject to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which \ncould have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements \ntargeting China\u2019s semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as \nwell as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China \n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any \nother systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any \nfuture NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well \nas any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of \nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the \nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 \nand H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth \nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi",
  "Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance \nthresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the \nexport of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent \nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing \nrequirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. We have not \nreceived licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\nFollowing these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and \ndistribution operations out of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and \nadversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any \nsuch transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including \nthose for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a \ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer. However, the \nlicensing process is time-consuming. We have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license or that the USG will act \non the license application in a timely manner or at all. Even if a license is offered, it may impose burdensome conditions \nthat we or our customer or end users cannot or decide not to accept. The USG is evaluating license requests in a closed \nprocess that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, \nor \u201cNAC,\u201d process has not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for \nexports to D1 and D4 countries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions for countries outside China. \nThe requirements have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future \n26",
  "disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that are not subject to the new restrictions or \nmay be able to acquire licenses for their products.\nManagement of these new licenses and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position \nhas been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are \nfurther changes in the USG\u2019s export controls, including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope \nof the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if customers develop their own internal solution, if we \nare unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG does not grant licenses in a \ntimely manner or denies licenses to significant customers or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG \ngrants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our \ncustomers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The licensing requirements may benefit certain of our \ncompetitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support efforts more cumbersome \nand less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor \nsuppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again \nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and \nlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be \nunable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the \nlicensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, \nincluding the Middle East. For example, the USG has already imposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to \ncreate and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by imposing license conditions on the use of products \nto be exported to certain countries, or by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or impair \nGPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain \ngaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant \nportion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, \nincluding the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of \nour products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell \ndatacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. \nThe USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit \nthe ability of downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a \nwider range of our products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against \ncertain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls \nhave already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to \u201cdesign-out\u201d \ncertain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are \nable to serve markets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future \nencourage overseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or \nother U.S. firms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export \ncontrols may negatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as \nEurope, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. \nadvanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new \nunilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign \ncompetitors, which would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.\nAdditionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games \nmay adversely affect our Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect",
  "our Data Center revenue. The Chinese government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain customers of our \nproducts, or any products containing components made by our partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese \ngovernment announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain products made by Micron, a \nsupplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our \nbusiness and financial results.\nFinally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially \nin Taiwan. Any new restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from \nTaiwan, would negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIncreased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could \nresult in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customers and suppliers to do \nbusiness with us.\nShareholder advocacy groups, certain investment funds, other market participants, shareholders, customers and \ngovernment regulators have focused increasingly on corporate sustainability practices and disclosures, including those \nassociated with climate change and human rights. Stakeholders may not be satisfied with our corporate sustainability \npractices and goals or the speed of their adoption. Further, there is an increasing number of state-level initiatives in the \nU.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements or our various stakeholders\u2019 expectations. Additionally, our \ncorporate sustainability practices, oversight of our practices or disclosure controls may not meet evolving shareholder, \n27",
  "regulator or other industry stakeholder expectations, or we may fail to meet corporate sustainability disclosure or \nreporting standards. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report, and comply \nwith various corporate sustainability practices, choose not to conduct business with potential customers, or discontinue \nor not expand business with existing customers due to our policies. These factors may negatively harm our brand, \nreputation and business activities or expose us to liability.\nIssues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or \nfinancial harm and liability.\nConcerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may \nresult in reputational or financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are \nincreasingly building AI capabilities and protections into many of our products and services, and we also offer stand-alone \nAI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and challenges that could affect its \nadoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or \nactual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences, infringe copyright or rights of \npublicity, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment or other social, economic or \npolitical issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and frameworks relating to the responsible \ndevelopment and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience brand or \nreputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions \nrelated to AI could increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or \nmay impede our ability to offer certain products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with \nregulations. Compliance with existing and proposed government regulation of AI, including in jurisdictions such as the \nEuropean Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to the Biden administration\u2019s Executive Order on \nAI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional reporting and/or transparency \nrequirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify the \nUSG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could \ndisproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively \nimpact our financial results. Our failure to adequately address concerns and regulations relating to the responsible use of \nAI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in our products and services or cause \nreputational or financial harm.\nActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be \nharmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other IP rights \nviolations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify. An unfavorable ruling could include \nsignificant damages, invalidation of one or more patents, indemnification of third parties, payment of lost profits, or \ninjunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could \ncause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts \nand attention of management and technical personnel.\nWe may commence legal proceedings to protect our IP rights, which may increase our operating expenses. We could be \nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a \nthird party\u2019s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party\u2019s IP rights. If we or one of our \nindemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities \nor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make \nroyalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially \nreasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other \nindemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.",
  "indemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing \narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our \nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and \nproducts more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information \ncould harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in \nresearch and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our \nemployees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing \nand new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be \napproved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. \nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result \nin legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, \nindustry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such \ndata by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard \n28",
  "to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including \nfor use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or \nmisuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory \nproceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal claims.\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including \nfor data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states \nhave enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing \nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As \napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain \ndata processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these \nrights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter \nrequirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy \nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer \nPrivacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives \nCalifornia residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive \ndetailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional violation \nand the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other \nstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related \nto the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data \nprivacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase. \nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data \nprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom \nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic \nArea, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data \nis stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to \npenalties of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer \nprotection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI \nAct could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to change \nour business practices.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the \nUnited States or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data \ntransfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. \nThe European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d designed for entities to validly transfer \npersonal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of \nprotection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.\u2019s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as \nwell as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-\nbased organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to \ntransfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal \nchallenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to \nthe United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws \nand local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could \nresult in fines from regulators. For example, China\u2019s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and",
  "data localization. Data broadly defined as important under China\u2019s law, including personal data, may not be transferable \noutside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance \nwith these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to \nincur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The \ninability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, \nlimit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or \nrequire us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some \nEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the \nGDPR\u2019s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such \nobligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the \nGDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We \nsometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, \nit could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy \npolicies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory \nprinciples, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking \nin transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement \nactions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\n29",
  "Data protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly \nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product \ndesign and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties \nthat process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with \nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, \nwe could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, \nadditional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use \npersonal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in \ntax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. \nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are \nregularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, \nany adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed \non our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our \nfuture tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way \nwe conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States, with a significant portion qualifying for \npreferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is \nreduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In \naddition, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive \nFramework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules announced by The Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by countries, may \nincrease tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial \ncondition.\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory \nrates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, \nthe expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization \nof tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and \nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact \nof accounting for business combinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business \nand structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price \nmay significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in \nreduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our \nfinancial results.\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or \ninvestigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we \nare defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our \nofficers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining \non GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings \ncould occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain \nproducts, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An",
  "unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be \ncostly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations, and prevent us from \nimplementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nAs of January 28, 2024, we had net outstanding a total of $9.7 billion in notes due by 2060. As each series of senior notes \nmatures, unless redeemed or repurchased, we must repay or refinance the notes. If we decide to refinance, we may \nreceive less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance at all, which may adversely affect our financial condition. \nWe also have a $575 million commercial paper program.\nMaintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restrictions could cause us to dedicate a substantial \nportion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; increase our \nvulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions; limit our flexibility regarding \nchanges in our business and our industry; impair our ability to obtain future financing; and restrict our ability to grant \nliens on property, enter into certain mergers, dispose of our assets, or materially change our business.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in our indenture may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any \nof the covenants without a waiver from the note holders or lenders, then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared \n30",
  "immediately due and payable. Changes to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities, \nrestrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the terms of any such financing.\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a \nchange in control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in \ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a \nmajority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue \npreferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder \napproval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent or call special meetings; advance notice requirements \nfor director nominations and shareholder proposals; and a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions \nin our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an \noffer to purchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to \npurchase the stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and \nmake it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate \nactions they desire.\nItem 1B.

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nWe have in place certain infrastructure, systems, policies, and procedures that are designed to proactively and reactively \naddress circumstances that arise when unexpected events such as a cybersecurity incident occur. These include \nprocesses for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our information security \nmanagement program generally follows processes outlined in frameworks such as the ISO 27001 international standard \nfor Information Security and we evaluate and evolve our security measures as appropriate. We consult with external \nparties, such as cybersecurity firms and risk management and governance experts, on risk management and strategy.\nIdentifying, assessing, and managing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and \nprocesses, and we have in place cybersecurity and data privacy training and policies designed to (a) respond to new \nrequirements in global privacy laws and (b) prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate and recover from identified and \nsignificant cybersecurity threats.\nWe also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires \ndesigned to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks that we may encounter when working with third parties that have access \nto confidential and other sensitive company information. We take steps designed to ensure that such vendors have \nimplemented data privacy and security controls that help mitigate the cybersecurity risks associated with these vendors. \nWe routinely assess our high-risk suppliers\u2019 conformance to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, ISO 28001, and C-TPAT), \nand we evaluate them for additional information, product, and physical security requirements.\nRefer to \u201cItem 1A.

The Audit Committee of the Board, or the Audit Committee, \nalso reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information security policies and practices and the \ninternal controls regarding information security risks. The Audit Committee receives regular information security updates \nfrom management, including our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team. The Board also receives \nannual reports on information security matters from our Chief Security Officer and members of our security team.\nOur security efforts are managed by a team of executive cybersecurity, IT, engineering, operations, and legal \nprofessionals. We have established a cross-functional leadership team, consisting of executive-level leaders, that meets \nregularly to review cybersecurity matters and evaluate emerging threats. With oversight and guidance provided by the \ncross-functional leadership team, our information security teams refine our practices to address emerging security risks \nand changes in regulations. Our executive-level leadership team also participates in cybersecurity incident response \nefforts by engaging with the incident response team and helping direct the company\u2019s response to and assessment of",
  "certain cybersecurity incidents.\nWe have designated a Chief Security Officer that reports to our Senior Vice President of Software Engineering to manage \nour assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats.

During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21\u00a0million shares of our common stock for $9.7\u00a0billion. \nAs of January\u00a0 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our \ncommon stock up to $22.5 billion.\nThe repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading \nplan or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with \nRule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The \nprogram does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be \nsuspended at any time at our discretion.\nIn fiscal year 2024, we paid\u00a0 $395 million\u00a0 in quarterly cash dividends.

  "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u00a0\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction \nwith \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary \nstatements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell \nshares of our common stock.\u00a0\nOverview\nOur Company and Our Businesses\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original \nfocus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has \nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data \nscience, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in \nDelaware in April 1998. \nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering \ncustomer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center \nproducts ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, \nadded new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase \nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity \nand execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of \nfiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may continue to enter into new \nsupplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very \nstrong.  We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur \ninventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products \nor demand declines.\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-\nterm supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address \nour business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our \nproduct development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, \ncreating additional supply chain complexity.\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and \nour channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost \nalways in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming \nproducts. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI \nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our \nsupply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating \nproduct transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product \nintroductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly \nintroduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or \nother costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to \nthe complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases \nor otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple \nproduct architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and \nimpact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX \nCloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases,",
  "applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to \ngenerate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI \nmodels, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is \nunknown.\n34",
  "Global Trade\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, \nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or \nany other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products \ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth \nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi \nArabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance \nthresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the \nexport of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent \nheadquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing \nrequirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Our sales to \nChina decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center \nproduct portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice \nbefore each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market in small volumes. China represented a \nmid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing \nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a \ncustomer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no \nassurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or \nat all.\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the \nlong term, if there are further changes in the USG\u2019s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and \nrising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further \nsubject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our \nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and \nmay be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from \nall or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East.\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-\nPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative \nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors \u2013 Risks Related to \nRegulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\u201d for a discussion of this potential impact.\nMacroeconomic Factors\nMacroeconomic factors, including\u202f inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain \nconstraints and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of \noperations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors \ncan also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our \ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within \nour supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\u202f\nIsrael and Hamas Conflict\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and \nsafety of our approximately 3,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, \noperations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2024 include \nexpenses for financial support to impacted employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our \nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Further, in connection with the conflict, a substantial",
  "number of our employees in the region have been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our \nemployees in Israel have been absent for an extended period and they or others may continue to be absent, which may \ncause disruption to our product development or operations. We did not experience any significant impact or expense to \nour business; however, if the conflict is further extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and \nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\n35",
  "Fiscal Year 2024 Summary\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\n\u00a0\nJan 28, 2024\nJan 29, 2023\nChange\n($ in millions, except per share data)\nRevenue\n$ \n60,922 \n$ \n26,974 \nUp 126%\nGross margin\n 72.7 %\n 56.9 %\nUp 15.8 pts\nOperating expenses\n$ \n11,329 \n$ \n11,132 \nUp 2%\nOperating income\n$ \n32,972 \n$ \n4,224 \nUp 681%\nNet income\n$ \n29,760 \n$ \n4,368 \nUp 581%\nNet income per diluted share\n$ \n11.93 \n$ \n1.74 \nUp 586%\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These \nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our \nplatforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and \nAutomotive.\nRevenue for fiscal year 2024 was $60.9 billion, up 126% from a year ago.\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 217%. Strong demand was driven by enterprise software and consumer \ninternet applications, and multiple industry verticals including automotive, financial services, and healthcare. Customers \nacross industry verticals access NVIDIA AI infrastructure both through the cloud and on-premises. Data Center compute \nrevenue was up 244% in the fiscal year. Networking revenue was up 133% in the fiscal year. \nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 15%. The increase reflects higher sell-in to partners following the \nnormalization of channel inventory levels and growing demand. \nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was up 1%.\nAutomotive revenue for the fiscal year 2024 was up 21%. The increase primarily reflected growth in self-driving platforms.\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory \nprovisions as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating expenses increased for fiscal year 2024, driven by growth in employees and compensation increases. Fiscal \nyear 2023 also included a $1.4 billion acquisition termination charge related to the proposed Arm transaction.\nMarket Platform Highlights\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $47.5 billion, up 217% from fiscal year 2023. In Data Center, we launched AI \ninference platforms that combine our full-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace \nHopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads. We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI \nFoundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV \nalgorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA\u2019s automotive data \ncenter processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center \nrevenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers represented more than half \nof our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA \nSpectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the GeForce \nRTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. We announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine for \nGames, a custom AI model foundry service using AI-powered natural language interactions to transform games and \nlaunched DLSS 3.5 Ray Reconstruction. Additionally, we released TensorRT-LLM for Windows and launched GeForce RTX \n40-Series SUPER GPUs. Gaming reached a milestone of 500 AI-powered RTX games and applications utilizing NVIDIA \nDLSS, ray tracing and other NVIDIA RTX technologies.\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.6 billion, up 1% from fiscal year 2023. In Professional \nVisualization, we announced new GPUs based on the NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace architecture, and announced NVIDIA \nOmniverse Cloud, a fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure, for the development and deployment of industrial \nmetaverse applications.\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $1.1 billion, up 21% from fiscal year 2023. In Automotive, we announced a \npartnership with MediaTek, which will develop mainstream automotive systems on chips for global OEMs integrating a \nnew NVIDIA GPU chiplet IP for AI and graphics. We furthered our collaboration with Foxconn to develop next-generation \n36",
  "electric vehicles, and announced further adoption of NVIDIA DRIVE platform with BYD, XPENG, GWM, Li Auto, ZEEKR and \nXiaomi.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the \nUnited States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments \nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of \ncontingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty \nand could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting \nestimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the \nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant \naccounting policies.\nInventories\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or \nfor obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate \nto excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase \ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management \njudgment.\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in \nbusiness and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our \nproducts, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product \nintroductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate \ncustomer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of \nchanges in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or \ndeferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an \nunfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase \ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead \ntimes and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond \ntwelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in \nadvance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also \nadjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product \ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further \ndiscussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is \nbased on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. \nOur estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an \nanticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or \nchanges in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax \ncontingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine \nthat payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may \nbe required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion, respectively, \nrelated to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are \nnot likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the \nextent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets \nas income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon",
  "audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to \nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n37",
  "Revenue Recognition\nRevenue Allowances\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for \nestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if \nproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional \nsales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain \nstocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. \nFor shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based \non applicable facts and circumstances.\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue \nand accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs \ninclude distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require \njudgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a \ncombination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services \nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as \na percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project \nincludes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each \nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, \nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or \ninterdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered \ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations \narrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based \non directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If \nstandalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we \ndetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology \nand usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from \nthree years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The \nestimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33\u00a0million and $102\u00a0million for cost of revenue and \noperating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\u00a0million and net income of \n$114\u00a0million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. \nResults of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 \nis presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared \nto fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January\u00a029, \n2023, filed with the SEC on February\u00a0 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at http://\nwww.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\n38",

  "All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal \nyear 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.\nConcentration of Revenue\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end \ncustomers, such as enterprises and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the \nUnited States accounted for 56% and 69% of total revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur direct and indirect customers include public cloud, consumer internet companies, enterprises, startups, public sector \nentities, OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, AIB, and distributors.\nSales to one customer, Customer A, represented 13% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, which was attributable to the \nCompute & Networking segment.\nOne indirect customer which primarily purchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including \nthrough Customer A, is estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue for fiscal year 2024, \nattributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nOur estimated Compute & Networking demand is expected to remain concentrated.\nThere were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the \ncost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, \nmanufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, \ninventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs.\u00a0 Cost of revenue also \nincludes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-\nbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nOur overall gross margin increased to 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 from 56.9% in fiscal year 2023. The year over year increase \nwas primarily due to strong Data Center revenue growth of 217% and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of \nrevenue.\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion for both fiscal years 2024 and \n2023. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a \nprovision release of $540 million and $137 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net effect on our gross \nmargin was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% and 7.5% in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\n\u00a0\nYear Ended\n\u00a0\nJan 28, 2024\nJan 29, 2023\n$\nChange\n%\nChange\n\u00a0\n($ in millions)\nResearch and development expenses\n$ \n8,675 \n$ \n7,339 \n$ \n1,336 \n 18 %\n% of net revenue\n 14.2 %\n 27.2 %\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSales, general and administrative expenses\n \n2,654 \n \n2,440 \n \n214 \n 9 %\n% of net revenue\n 4.4 %\n 9.1 %\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAcquisition termination cost\n \n\u2014 \n \n1,353 \n \n(1,353) \n (100) %\n% of net revenue\n \u2014 %\n 5.0 %\nTotal operating expenses\n$ \n11,329 \n$ \n11,132 \n$ \n197 \n 2 %\n% of net revenue\n 18.6 %\n 41.3 %\nThe increase in research and development expenses and sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2024 \nwas primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and \ncompensation increases.\nAcquisition Termination Cost\nWe recorded an acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction of $1.4\u00a0billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting \nthe write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.\n40",

Change in Other, net, compared to fiscal year 2023 was driven by changes in value \nfrom our non-affiliated investments.

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 12.0% for fiscal year 2024 and a \nbenefit of 4.5% for fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns \nfor fiscal years 2018 and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS \naudit resolution, for effectively settled positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of \n$236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of federal benefit, partially offset by additional cash tax \npayments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.\nThe effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based \ncompensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase \nin the effective tax rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily \nto tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective \ntax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.\nThe OECD has announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules for \na new 15% global minimum tax applicable to large multinational corporations. Certain jurisdictions, including European \nUnion member states and the United Kingdom, have enacted Pillar Two legislation that will start to become effective for \nour fiscal year 2025. The OECD, and its member countries, continue to release new guidance and legislation on Pillar Two \nand we continue to evaluate the impact on our financial position of the global implementation of these rules. Based on \nenacted laws, Pillar Two is not expected to materially impact our effective tax rate or cash flows in the next fiscal year. \nNew legislation or guidance could change our current assessment.\nRefer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part\u00a0IV, Item\u00a015 of this Annual Report on \nForm\u00a010-K for additional information.\n41",

Accounts receivable balance in fiscal year 2024 reflected $557 million from customer payments received ahead \nof the invoice due date.\nCash provided by investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by lower \nmarketable securities maturities and higher purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023, due to a debt repayment and \nhigher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share repurchases.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our \noperations. At the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $26.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We \nbelieve that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for \nthe foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and $1.3 billion of debt repayment due in fiscal year 2025 \nand share purchases. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external \ncapital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nOur marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated \ncorporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly \nrated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

During fiscal year 2024, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for $9.7\u00a0billion. \nAs of January 28, 2024, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our \n42",

Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares \nissued to employees. We may pursue additional share repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment \nopportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued \nfor employee compensation made after December 31, 2022 which was not material for fiscal year 2024.\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January\u00a028, 2024, by year payable, are as follows:\n\u00a0\nJan 28, 2024\n\u00a0\n(In millions)\nDue in one year\n$ \n1,250 \nDue in one to five years\n \n2,250 \nDue in five to ten years\n \n2,750 \nDue in greater than ten years\n \n3,500 \nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs\n \n(41) \nNet carrying amount\n \n9,709 \nLess short-term portion\n \n(1,250) \nTotal long-term portion\n$ \n8,459 \nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

The investment \nportfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and growth of \nour businesses.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our \nanalysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 0.5% would result in a change in fair value for these investments \nof $93 million.\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2024, we had $9.7 billion of senior Notes net outstanding. We carry the Notes at face value \nless unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no \n43",
  "financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements in Part\u00a0IV, Item\u00a015 of this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K for additional information. \nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States \ndollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate \nmovements.\u00a0Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The impact \nof foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024 \nand 2023.\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, \ntherefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to \nother currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. \nConversely, decreases in the value of the United States\u2019 dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers \nraising their manufacturing costs.\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January\u00a028, 2024 and January\u00a029, 2023, the amount recorded in accumulated \nother comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $116 \nmillion and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \nwould be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have \nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January\u00a0 28, 2024 and \nJanuary\u00a0 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by \ncorresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the \nhedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.\nRefer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form \n10-K for additional information. \nItem\u00a08.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our \nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the \neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\u00a028, 2024 based on the criteria set forth in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework, our \nmanagement concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January\u00a028, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\u00a0 28, 2024 has been audited by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included \nherein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January\u00a028, 2024 \nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In \nfiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, which will update much of our \n44",
  "existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report \noperating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes \nthat materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure \ncontrols and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well \nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system \nare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the \nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, \nno evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within \nNVIDIA have been detected.\nItem\u00a09B.\u00a0\u00a0Other Information\nOn December 18, 2023, John O. Dabiri, a member of our Board of Directors, adopted a trading arrangement that is \nintended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) for the sale through December 2, 2024 of an \nestimated 553 shares of our common stock, assuming our closing stock price as of January 26, 2024. The number of \nshares is based on an estimate because the plan specifies a formulaic dollar amount of shares to be sold.\nItem 9C.

  "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the \n\u201cCompany\u201d) as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, \ncomprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 28, \n2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) \n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control \nover financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition of the Company as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows \nfor each of the three years in the period ended January 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally \naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective \ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - \nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, \nincluded in Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our \nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal \ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in \naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that \nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design \nand operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such \nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \nfor our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of",

  "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates \nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially \nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our \nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit \nmatter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it \nrelates.\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for \ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase \ncommitments. Most of the Company\u2019s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the \nCompany\u2019s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand \nand market conditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company\u2019s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the \nCompany\u2019s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was \n$16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, \nspecifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit \nmatter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and \nexcess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market \nconditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and \nevaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.  \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls \nrelating to management\u2019s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, \nincluding controls over management\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures \nalso included, among others, testing management\u2019s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete \ninventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management\u2019s approach; \ntesting the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of \nmanagement\u2019s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management\u2019s assumptions \nrelated to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were \nreasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external \nmarket and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology. \n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary\u00a021, 2024\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2004. \n49",

  "Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOur Company\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in \nDelaware in April 1998. \nAll references to \u201cNVIDIA,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-\nweek years.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All \nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities \nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. \nActual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those \nrelated to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product \npurchase commitments, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, \nrestructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on \nhistorical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology \nand usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three \nto four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. The effect of this change for the \nfiscal year ended January\u00a0 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33\u00a0 million and $102\u00a0 million for cost of revenue and operating \nexpenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\u00a0million and net income of $114\u00a0million \nafter tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, \nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification \nof the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the \ntransaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is \nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the \nstandalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a \nperformance obligation.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects \nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an \nextended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are \nrecognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for \nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for \nestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if \nproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional \nsales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in \nvarious target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that \nare earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners\u2019 activities while also \npromoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs \nfor potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n55",
  "License and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP \ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a \nsingle performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to \ncompletion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each \nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\nSoftware Licensing\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. \nCustomers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over \nwhich the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a \nwhen-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software licenses is \nrecognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably \nover the service period, or as services are performed.\nCloud Services\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of \nthe software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue \nrelated to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud \nservices based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain \nofferings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support. \nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately \naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a \nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely \nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations \narrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge \nfor a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. When \ndetermining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.  \nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\nProduct Warranties\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for \nmanufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product \nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an \nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification \nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair \nvalue of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial \nperformance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of \nperformance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for \nRSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service \nperiod while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair \nvalue of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the \ncommencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is \nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we \nestimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ \nfrom those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential \nregulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment,",
  "competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. \nThere are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions \nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\n56",
  "or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or \njudgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, \ninvestigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will \nrecord the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be \nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are \nremeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as \nproperty and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured \nat exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet \namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are \nincluded in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or \nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or \nliabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; \nand we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on \navailable evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing \nwith uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change \nbased, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in \nthe U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize \nliabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to \nwhich, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax \nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income \ntax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\nAs of January\u00a028, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\u00a0billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state \nand other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional \nprojections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes \nmore-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon \naudit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to \nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nNet Income Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the \nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive \nshares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards \noutstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three \nmonths or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt \ninvestments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as \ncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as \navailable-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and \nlosses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. The \nfair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of",
  "marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income \n(expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-\nfor-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected \ncredit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or \nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\n57",
  "we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs \nare recognized in the other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair \nvalues due to their relatively short maturities as of January\u00a028, 2024 and January\u00a029, 2023. Marketable securities are \ncomprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses \nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders\u2019 equity, net of tax. Fair value \nof the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as \neither assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative \ndepends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair \nvalue hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses \nor gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow \nhedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other \ncomprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in \nearnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in \nearnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, \nmarketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income \nsecurities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio \nduration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition and maintain an allowance for \npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on \noverall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of \ncredit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-\nout basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing \nand packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test \nyield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We \ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for \nobsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to \nexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to \nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it \ncreates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable \npurchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our \nvaluation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is \ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once \nan asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are \nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation \nexpense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded \nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 \nmonths are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease \nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the \nlease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.",
  "Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments \ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and \nprepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease \nwhen it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over \nthe lease term.\nWe combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\n58",
  "Goodwill\nGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of \npotential impairment exist.\u00a0 In completing our\u00a0 impairment test, we\u00a0 perform either a qualitative or a quantitative \nanalysis\u00a0on a reporting unit basis.\u00a0\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events \nand factors affecting the reporting units. \nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting \nunit\u2019s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, \nprospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly \ntraded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic \nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\u00a0\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer \nrelationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our \nintangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern \nin which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be \nreliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. \nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for \nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group \nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of \nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated \nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an \nimpairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the \nestimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash \nflows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately \npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair \nvalue less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.\nBusiness Combination\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and \nintangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over \nthe fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management\u2019s estimates of \nfair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently \nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not \nlimited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of \nthese cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from \nthe estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may \nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the \nmeasurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, \nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable \nequity securities, which are investments in privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily \ndeterminable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity \nsecurities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily \ndeterminable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from \nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the",
  "measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation requires our \njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments, \nrealized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted \nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for \nnon-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge \nthrough other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\n59",

Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January\u00a028, 2024, up \nto 37 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. \nCurrently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January\u00a028, 2024, there \nwere 147 million shares available for future grants.\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs granted to employees vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, \nwith 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting \nquarterly thereafter, (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date \nthat is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (C) over a four-year period, \nsubject to continued service, with 6.25% vesting quarterly.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and \ncertain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange \nAct, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact \nof cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

Plaintiffs sought class \ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including \nattorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district \ncourt granted NVIDIA\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and \nclosed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the \nNinth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part \nand reversed in part the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district \ncourt did not err in dismissing the case.
