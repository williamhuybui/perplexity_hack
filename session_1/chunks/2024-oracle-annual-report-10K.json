  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nPART I\nItem 1.\nBusiness\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include \nenterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT \ndeployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-\npremise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle \nCloud in a customer\u2019s own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other \npublic clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment \ncombinations that best suit our customers\u2019 needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational \ninstitutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle \nPartner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external \nproducts, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses Oracle \nCloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses OCI to power its logistics \nand mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata \nCloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) \nfor its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.\nOracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and \ninfrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud \nServices integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle \ndeploys, manages, supports and upgrades for customers and that customers may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad \nspectrum of devices. \nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and \nexperienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment \nmodels to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud \nenvironments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and implementing usage-based resource consumption costs; \nand highly secure, standards-based and reliable. \nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle \nMiddleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own \ncloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they \npurchase an Oracle license. \nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. \nCustomers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products. \nOracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in \nOracle products and services. \nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure \ntechnologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible \nand interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and \nbetter addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment \nmodels and less flexibility for a customer\u2019s transition to cloud-based IT environments.\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud \nand license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In \nfiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we invested $8.9 billion, $8.6 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, in research and development to \nenhance our existing portfolio of offerings and to develop new technologies and services.

We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, \nreliability, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which \norganizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and incorporating emerging technologies such as AI within \nour offerings to enable leaner business processes, automation and innovation. For example, our Oracle Autonomous Database is \ndesigned to deliver transformational infrastructure as an OCI offering that uses machine learning capabilities to automate many \ntraditionally manual functions. \nAfter an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and \ndevelopment efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware \ndeployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle \nCloud Services contracts with us. \nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nOracle Cloud Operations\nOracle Cloud Operations deliver our Oracle Cloud Services to customers through a secure, reliable, scalable, enterprise grade cloud \ninfrastructure platform managed by Oracle employees within a global network of data centers, which we refer to as the Oracle Cloud. \nThe Oracle Cloud enables secure and isolated cloud-based instances for each of our customers to access the functionality of Oracle \nCloud Services via a broad spectrum of devices. Oracle Cloud Operations leverage automated software tools to enable the rapid \ndelivery of the latest cloud technology capabilities to the Oracle Cloud as they become available and provide Oracle customers access \nto the latest Oracle releases. We have invested in the rapid expansion of the Oracle Cloud by increasing existing data center capacity \nand adding data centers in new geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand. We expect this trend will \ncontinue. \nManufacturing \nWe rely on third-party manufacturing partners to produce most of our hardware products that we market and sell to customers and \nutilize internally to deliver Oracle Cloud Services, and we distribute most of our hardware products from these partners\u2019 facilities. Our \nmanufacturing processes are substantially based on standardization of components across product types and centralization of \nassembly and distribution centers. Production of our hardware products requires that we purchase materials, supplies, product \nsubassemblies and full assemblies from a number of suppliers. For most of our hardware products, we have existing alternative \nsources of supply or such sources are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain hardware components. We \nmonitor and evaluate potential risks of disruption within our supply chain operations. Refer to Risk Factors included in Item 1A within \nthis Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with respect to the sources and availability of supplies for \nour hardware products and the related risks to our businesses. \nSales and Marketing\nWe directly market and sell our cloud, license, hardware, support and services offerings globally to businesses of many sizes and in \nmany industries, government agencies and educational institutions. We also market and sell our offerings globally through indirect \nchannels. \nIn the United States (U.S.), our sales and services employees are based throughout the country. Outside the U.S., our international \nsubsidiaries sell, support and service our offerings in their local countries as well as within other foreign countries where we do not \noperate through a direct sales subsidiary. Our geographic coverage allows us to draw on business and technical expertise from a \nglobal workforce, provides stability to our operations and revenue streams to offset geography-specific economic trends and offers us \nan opportunity to take advantage of new markets for our offerings. Our international operations subject us to certain risks, which are \nmore fully described in Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this Annual Report. A summary of our domestic and international revenues \nand long-lived assets is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe also market our product offerings worldwide through indirect channels. The companies that comprise our indirect channel \nnetwork are members of the Oracle Partner Network. The Oracle Partner Network is a global program that manages our business \nrelationships with a large, broad-based network of companies, including cloud and license, hardware and services suppliers, system \nintegrators and resellers that deliver innovative solutions and services based upon and in conjunction with our product offerings. By \noffering our partners access to our product offerings, educational information, technical services, marketing and sales support, the \nOracle Partner Network program extends our market reach by providing our partners with the resources they need to be successful in \ndelivering solutions to customers globally.\nResearch and Development\nWe develop the substantial majority of our products and services offerings internally utilizing the skills and diversity of a global \nworkforce. In addition, we have extended our products and services offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of \nbusinesses and technologies. We also purchase or license intellectual property rights in certain circumstances. Internal development \nallows us to maintain technical control over the design and \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n26/194",

We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects \nof our products and technology. However, although we believe that our patents have value, neither our business as a whole nor any of \nour principal businesses are materially dependent on a single patent. Rapid technological advances in cloud, software and hardware \ndevelopment, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new \nproduct introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a \nsignificant amount of resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services \nofferings. \nHuman Capital Resources\nAt Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We \nstrive to attract and retain talented employees, to support employee success and well-being and to foster a culture where everyone \nhas a voice in driving innovation. Our Board of Directors oversees culture and inclusion (C&I) matters and the Compensation \nCommittee of our Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) is responsible for reviewing and monitoring matters related to \nhuman capital management, including talent acquisition and retention.\nWorkforce\nAs of May 31, 2024, we employed approximately 159,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 58,000 were employed in the \nU.S. and approximately 101,000 were employed internationally.

By promoting an inclusive culture that values acceptance and belonging and provides \nopportunities for all, we seek to enable and inspire our workforce to help our customers solve hard problems. Our focus on C&I is \nreflected throughout our organization, starting at the highest level. Our Chief Executive Officer is a woman and forty percent of the \nmembers of our Board of Directors are women and/or come from a diverse background. We endeavor to hire employees from a broad \npool of talent with diverse backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and abilities, and we believe Oracle\u2019s leaders serve as role models \nfor the inclusive culture in our workforce. We strive to enable our employees to further their careers, build their networks and foster \nthe skills needed to succeed at Oracle, including through participation in our Employee Resource Groups, which offer employees \nopportunities to engage in mentor relationships that further develop inclusive leaders and employees at Oracle. We seek to \ncontinuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diverse \nrepresentation at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the globe with strategic sponsorship from Oracle\u2019s \nInclusive Leadership Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking \nglobally on Oracle\u2019s five C&I Imperatives:\n\u2022\nData and Talent Analytics: leveraging data, global insights, programs and systems that drive inclusive experiences;\n\u2022\nMulti-Generation: ensuring intentional and unbiased investment in talent;\n14\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n28/194",

Employee satisfaction on the importance of C&I at Oracle and \ntheir managers\u2019 leveraging a range of diverse perspectives and voices ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.\nWe are proud to be recognized for our ongoing progress and commitment to C&I. Examples of recognition received include being \nnamed one of the World\u2019s Best Employers and World\u2019s Top Companies for Women by Forbes in 2023 and one of America\u2019s Best \nEmployers For Diversity by Forbes in 2024; a Best Place to Work by the Disability Equality Index in 2023 for the sixth consecutive year; \na 2023/2024 Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign; a 2024 5-Star Employer by VETS Indexes; one of \nthe Top 50 Workplaces for Indigenous STEM Professionals by American Indian Science and Engineering Society in 2024; and a 2023 \nTop Supporter of Historically Black College and University Engineering Schools by Career Communications Group.\nEmployee Experience\nOracle strives to deliver a great employee experience, anchored by meaningful work, career opportunities and well-being to continue \nto attract and retain high quality talent. We support employee well-being from multiple dimensions, including economic, health, \ndevelopment and lifestyle with a comprehensive suite of compensation, benefits and learning and development.\nOpportunities to Learn and Grow\nWe believe that one of the primary reasons candidates join Oracle is for the opportunity to develop their careers. We have programs \nand resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. We promote regular career conversations between \nleaders and employees. These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify \nand take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, which runs on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for \nleaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 32% of our open non-entry level positions were \nfilled internally in fiscal 2024, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.\nWe believe that helping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and \nrapidly evolve. We support employees with easily accessible learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. We \nbelieve that Oracle Learning enables us to improve our employees\u2019 learning experience and better measure learning consumption. \nOracle employees received more than five million hours of training in fiscal 2024 and accessed online learning content at an average \nrate of approximately two million views per month. Our employees take advantage of instructor-led classes, virtual library content and \nonline learning resources on sales, business, products, market/industry, leadership, technical skills and compliance, as well as well-\nbeing and personal development related topics.\nLeaders Who Listen\nWe believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee, customer and business success is \nlistening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct \nobservations from employees about areas critical to Oracle\u2019s strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. \nThe results of the survey are also discussed with our Board of Directors and committees thereof. In fiscal 2024, 81% of our employees \nparticipated in the annual survey. Leaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee, \nbusiness and customer success.\n15\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n30/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nMaking a Difference\nEach year, through our volunteering and giving programs, Oracle employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions \nof dollars (matched by Oracle) to a wide variety of causes. Oracle and our employees also rise to the occasion in times of crisis. \nDuring fiscal 2024, Oracle donated tens of millions of dollars to advance education, protect the natural world and wildlife, strengthen \ncommunities and promote health. Among our recent commitments is a $1 million multi-year grant to The National Museum of African \nAmerican History and Culture, a Smithsonian Institution museum located in Washington, D.C. In fiscal 2024, Oracle approved the \ndonation of technology and consulting services valued at $350,000 to advance the mission of the Military Family Advisory Network.  \nOracle is committed to being at the forefront of positive social impact through initiatives focused on education, the environment, \ncommunity and health. Our philanthropic education initiatives, Oracle Academy and the Oracle Education Foundation, help students \ndevelop the skills they need to become technology innovators and leaders. Oracle also hosts Design Tech High School, a public charter \nschool, at our Redwood Shores, California campus. Through our nonprofit organization, Oracle Health Foundation, we deliver \npediatric grants and school-based wellness programs to create healthier tomorrows and stronger communities.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force \nincentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are \ntypically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. See \u201cCloud and License Business\u201d in Item 7 of this \nAnnual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of the revenues, expenses and margins of our cloud and \nlicense business, which is our largest business.\nCompetition\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is \nconstantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive \npressures otherwise change.\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing \nmaintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings \nfrom some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc., \nAmazon.com, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Intel Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, \nSalesforce, Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low \nbarriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to \nchallenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to \nvendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand \ninto new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be \npartners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. For example, following our \nacquisition of Cerner Corporation (Cerner), we also face competition from large healthcare IT providers such as Allscripts Healthcare \nSolutions, Inc., Arcadia Solutions, athenahealth, Inc., Epic Systems Corporation and InterSystems Corporation, among others. \nMoreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions\u2014including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures or \nrepositioning of product lines\u2014which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories. \nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of \nownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of \ntechnical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our \ncompetitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:\n16\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n32/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by \nfactors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our discussion in Item 7 Management\u2019s Discussion and \nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive \nand you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing and selling new products and services, integrating acquired products and services and \nenhancing our existing products and services.   Our industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, intense competition, \nchanging delivery models, evolving standards in communications infrastructure, increasingly sophisticated customer needs and \nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements. We have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud \nproducts and services, but if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve \nour product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, \ncustomers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or \ncloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to our future success. In addition, we cannot provide any \nassurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business \nopportunities in emerging areas.\nIn addition, our business may be adversely affected if:\n\u2022\nwe do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced products and services within the anticipated time frames;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure costs to deliver new or enhanced products and services take longer or result in greater costs than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data centers in new geographic locations in a timely \nmanner to meet current or expected customer demand;\n\u2022\nwe fail to meet our contractual service level commitments;\n\u2022\nthere is a delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customers to new, enhanced or \nacquired product lines or services;\n\u2022\nsanctions, export controls or other regulatory, legislative or other barriers prevent us from serving certain customers or \nrestrict our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthere are changes in IT trends that we do not adequately anticipate or timely address with our product development efforts;\n\u2022\nwe do not optimize complementary product lines and services in a timely manner; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to adequately integrate, support or enhance acquired product lines or services.\nIn addition, our profitability and revenues could be adversely impacted if we lose one or more of our key customers for any reason, \nincluding as a result of any of the factors discussed above. Any such loss could also limit or reduce our growth in future periods.\nOur AI products may not operate as anticipated, which could adversely affect our reputation, revenues and profitability.   Machine \nlearning and AI, including generative AI, are increasingly driving innovations in technology, and AI technology and services are highly \ncompetitive and rapidly evolving. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to build and support our AI \nproducts, and if our AI products fail to operate as anticipated or as well as competing products or otherwise do not meet customer \nneeds or if our competitors\u2019 AI products achieve higher market acceptance than ours, we may fail to recoup our investments in AI and \nour business and reputation may be harmed. In addition, AI technologies are rapidly evolving and present emerging legal and ethical \nissues, including claims of bias, discrimination, a perceived lack of transparency, as well as sometimes unpredictable behaviors or \nimproper use of copyrighted or other protected material, such as personal and patient health information, any of which could expose \nus or our customers to reputational or legal risk and inhibit adoption of our AI products.

Our failure to adapt to these changes could result in legal and reputational consequences including, but not limited to, \nbeing required to adjust or limit our product offerings or our use of AI in certain jurisdictions to comply with new and evolving AI laws \nand regulations.\nIf we do not successfully execute our Oracle Cloud strategy, including our offerings of Oracle Cloud Services, our revenues and \nprofitability may decline.   We provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via a variety of deployment models, \nincluding via our cloud-based SaaS and OCI offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete \neffectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings.

If we \ndo not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation \nas a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.\nAs customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to \nthe differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware product \narrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers predominantly purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription \nbasis, and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably or as services are consumed over the terms of the \nsubscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable \nin our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product \narrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, \nwe may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transitions from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for \nour license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle \nCloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIf we are unable to secure data center capacity at affordable rates or do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity \nrequirements, our profitability may decline.   As a part of our Oracle Cloud strategy, we plan our investment levels based on \nestimates of future revenues and future anticipated rates of growth. In recent periods, our cloud services and license support \nexpenses have grown to meet current and expected demand for our cloud offerings, including investments to increase our existing \ndata center capacity and to establish data centers in new geographic locations. In connection with these investments, we entered, and \nexpect to continue to enter, into long-term operating lease commitments with third-party data center providers that generally require \nus to pay significant contract termination fees to early exit such obligations should our strategies change, which could adversely \nimpact our profitability and cash flows. Data centers in geographies that we rely on may also be unavailable on commercially \nreasonable terms or at all. Moreover, we do not control the operation of these third-party data centers, and they may suffer \ninterruptions in service from events beyond our control, including from acts of government, natural events, power loss, break-ins or \nmisconduct by those third parties. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide equipment and components required to \noutfit these data centers on a timely basis. Ongoing or future delays could cause the loss of additional sales, delay our revenue \nrecognition or increase our costs, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our business. We typically depreciate these assets \nover their estimated useful lives, which could be shortened should our cloud strategies change, which could adversely affect our \nprofitability.\nOur products and services may not function properly if we experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in \nour cloud, license and hardware offerings.   Despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, \nour cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their \nfunction, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released \ncloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings, or errors",
  "embedded in third-party software products or services incorporated into our own products, could affect their ability to properly \nfunction, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages \nof our cloud offerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new \nproducts or services or new versions of products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or \nservices. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new \nversions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle\u2019s business operations as \nwell as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks.

Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their \nbusinesses, and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability, \nperformance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed.   We face intense \ncompetition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as \nfirms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Our enterprise cloud, license and \nhardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world. In \naddition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors \nfrequently emerge to challenge our offerings. We believe many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop \nand market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, \nbusiness applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, \nwhich compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings. \nIn addition, use of our competitors\u2019 technologies can influence a customer\u2019s purchasing decision or create an environment that makes \nit less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services. For example, we offer our customers multicloud services whereby \nour customers can combine cloud services from multiple clouds with the goal of optimizing cost, functionality and performance. OCI\u2019s \nmulticloud services work with a number of our competitors\u2019 products, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google \nCloud Platform. This multicloud strategy could lead our customers to migrate away from our cloud offerings to our competitors\u2019 \nproducts or limit their purchases of additional Oracle products, either of which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services on terms that \nwe may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose \ncustomers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce \nprices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices, provide debt or equity financing \nto customers or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or \nacquisitions of our competitors by large companies may result in increased competition. \nIf our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more \nvaluable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings or offer other terms that are less favorable to us to \ncompete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, \nthe increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other \ncloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud \noperations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and profitability. Our license support fees and \nhardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. \nOur competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings. If \nwe do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products, changes in customer demand or increased \ncompetition, our revenues could decrease.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our \nfinancial results.   Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and \ninfrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for \nsupport services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues. Increased customer demand for these services,",
  "without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality \ntechnical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our \nreputation, our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our \nbusiness, operating results, and financial position.\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.

An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a \nsignificant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities, both through internal \ninvestments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies. Accelerated product and service introductions and \nshort lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if \nnot offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and \ndevelopment efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these \ninvestments for several years, if at all.\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the \nsourcing of technologies and components, the results of these businesses will suffer.   We depend on suppliers to develop, \nmanufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and \nsell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some \ntechnologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other \nbusiness constraints. Our supply chain operations are affected by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, \nnatural disasters, political unrest (such as the tensions between China and Taiwan), public health crises, changes to trade laws or \nregulations, port stoppages, shipping interruptions or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, and other factors affecting the \ncountries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If disruption \ncaused by one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related \noperating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may \nnot be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher \npurchases and balances of hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud \ninfrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, relative to our historical positions. While this permits us to secure manufacturing \ncapacity, it has increased excess and obsolescence risk of such hardware products and could adversely impact our profitability and \ncash flows. We expect these factors will continue to impact us in the future.\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware \nproducts to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience \nproduction problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the \nloss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely \naffect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our \nmanufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.   We periodically restructure or make other \nadjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, \nacquisitions and other internal and external considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted, and may in the future result, \nin increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while employees adjust to the restructuring. These types of \nrestructurings may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain \nthe expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these restructurings, or may not do so within the expected \ntimeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings, and our revenues and other \nresults of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.   We rely on hiring qualified employees and the \ncontinued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder;",
  "our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is \nsubstantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development and technical personnel, particularly in the \nAI field. Hiring freezes or slowdowns may result in decreased productivity while existing employees take on additional roles and \nresponsibilities, and may also lead to a shortage of sufficiently skilled employees in certain roles. \nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales.

Members of our senior \nmanagement team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and any future departures may be disruptive to our \noperations.\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical and other expertise \nare available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce \nreductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We are experiencing increased competition for employees in \nthese countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which has affected our employee retention efforts and increased our \nexpenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may \nadversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\nOur general compensation program includes restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based equity, which are important tools in \nattracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or \nattract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, which may have an \nimpact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our \ncompensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new \npersonnel.\nThere are risks associated with our cloud and license and hardware indirect sales channels which could affect our future operating \nresults.   Our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel networks are comprised primarily of resellers, system \nintegrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and ISVs. Our \nrelationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales \nefforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if: \n\u2022\nour contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;\n\u2022\nany of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant; \n\u2022\nthe financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or \n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our channel participants\u2019 products and services were to decrease. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel \nparticipants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. In addition, we do not control \nchannel participants, some of which operate in jurisdictions with high levels of corruption, and our compliance policies and \nprocedures may fail to prevent or detect violations of anti-corruption or other laws for which we may be held responsible. \nAcquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a \ntransaction.   We review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective \nand active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an \nimportant element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include:\n\u2022\nour ongoing business may be disrupted and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or \nintegration activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company\u2019s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets \nwhere we have no, or limited, direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3) \nretaining key personnel from the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or \ntechnology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that \nadversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our \ninvestments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment \nto assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022\nour operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities that we assume from an \nacquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships",

We believe that Oracle is a target for \ncomputer hackers, cyber threats and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including sensitive \ndata such as health sciences (including patient health information), financial services, retail, hospitality, telecommunications and \ngovernment data. We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or \ngroups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation-states and individuals sponsored by \nthem) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized \naccess to our or our customers\u2019, partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful \nattempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data \nof Oracle or our customers.

We also have an \nactive acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we \nmake significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when \nwe integrate these companies within Oracle.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of \ngovernmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.   As regulatory focus on \nprivacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and \nbecome more complex and stringent, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. In addition, \nU.S. federal and state as well as foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the \nnear future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of \nour customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer (including across national borders) and share \npersonal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide.

We expect to continue to receive such claims as:\n\u2022\nwe continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies;\n\u2022\nthe number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows;\n\u2022\nthe use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;\n\u2022\nthe volume of issued patents continues to increase; and\n\u2022\nnon-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could: \n\u2022\nbe time consuming, costly and result in litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s time and attention from developing our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find \nacceptable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products;\n\u2022\nrequire us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms;\n\u2022\nrequire us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or\n\u2022\notherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.   We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, \nconfidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these \nprotections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our \nintellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be \nissued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual \nproperty protection as U.S. laws and courts. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or \nother misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nAdverse litigation results could affect our business.   We are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive \nand disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management\u2019s attention away from running our core business. The results of our \nlitigation also cannot be predicted with certainty.

An adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results \nor financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 16 of Notes \nto Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits \nand controversies.   As a multinational corporation, we incur income taxes as well as non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, \nuse, property and value-added taxes) in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to \nthe application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, often requiring that we make judgments in determining our \ntax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the U.S. and internationally, \nwhich has led to disagreements regarding our treatment of various items, including our intercompany transfer prices and calculations \nand the applicability of withholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable resolution of these tax audits and \ncontroversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have a material and adverse impact on our provision for income taxes \nand effective tax rate. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no \nassurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax \nprovisions and tax accruals.\nCountries around the world continually consider and make changes to relevant tax, accounting and other laws, treaties, regulations, \nguidance and interpretations. In the U.S., various legislative proposals, if enacted, may substantially raise U.S. income taxes on our \ndomestic and international profits. Such unfavorable tax proposals, the prospects for which depend to a significant degree on the U.S. \npolitical landscape, create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a material \nadverse impact on our future income tax provisions and effective tax rate.\nOther countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our \ninternational revenue streams, operations and cross-border transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital \ntechnology businesses and changes in withholding tax rules. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \nand the Group of Twenty (G20), together with over 140 participating countries, have developed a two-pillar framework calling for a \n15% global minimum tax on multinational corporate groups, which has been adopted in many jurisdictions, and that would provide \ngreater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. These changes may materially increase the level of \nincome tax on our international profits.\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase under the tax changes discussed above or if other \nchanges are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income \ntaxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions with differing \nstatutory tax rates, fluctuations in our stock price and level of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\nOur international sales and operations and global customer base subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our \noperating results.   We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S., and in \nboth our U.S. and non-U.S. operations we serve customers based in or with ties to numerous jurisdictions around the world. \nCompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing \nbusiness. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related \nregulations, competition/antitrust regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as \nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, \nincluding but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in monetary",
  "fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, enforcement actions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct \nof our business, including disgorgement, the loss of trade privileges, and other remedial measures. Any such violations could result in \nprohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries or territories or to certain entities, could delay \nor prevent potential acquisitions and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our \nability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n53/194",

In addition, we continue to monitor relations between the U.S. and \nthe Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus and the People\u2019s Republic of China, among others. It is difficult to anticipate the effect \ninternational relations may have on us. Compliance with any further economic sanctions, export controls or other regulatory \nrestrictions (and any countermeasures thereto) taken by the U.S. or other countries could prevent us from serving certain customers \nor restrict us or our customers from operating in specific jurisdictions, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and \nresults of operations.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and thus, we are subject to several laws, regulations and industry initiatives, non-\ncompliance with certain of which could adversely affect our healthcare business.   As a participant in the healthcare industry, certain \nof our operations and relationships, and those of our customers, are regulated by several U.S. federal, state, local and foreign \ngovernmental entities. The impact of these regulations on us is both direct and also indirect, in terms of government program \nrequirements applicable to our customers for the use of health IT. Even though we may not be directly regulated by specific \nhealthcare laws and regulations, our products and services must be capable of being used by our customers in a way that complies \nwith those laws and regulations. There are significant, wide-ranging and rapidly evolving regulations both within and outside the U.S., \nsuch as regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud, information sharing, e-prescribing, claims processing and transmission, \nhealthcare devices, the security and privacy of patient data and interoperability standards, that may be directly or indirectly applicable \nto our operations and relationships or the business practices of our customers. Specific risks include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\nThe U.S. and other countries have regulations in place related to medical devices that now, or may in the future, apply to \ncertain of our healthcare products and services. If any of our healthcare products and services are deemed to be actively \nregulated medical devices by regulatory agencies in countries where we do business, we could be subject to extensive \nrequirements governing pre- and post-marketing activities, including pre-market notification clearance.\n\u2022\nVarious U.S. federal, state and non-government agencies continue to generate requirements for the use of certified \nelectronic health record technology (CEHRT), and CEHRT continues to be a requirement of participation in federal healthcare \nprograms in order to receive reimbursement for health items and services provided by certain of our customers to Medicare \nand Medicaid beneficiaries. We expect the regulations establishing the certification and interoperability standards for CEHRT \nwill continue to be updated to emphasize interoperability, consumer engagement, patient safety and health information \nprivacy and security.\nComplying with these regulations globally is expensive and could subject us to unanticipated and significant delays. If we fail to \ncomply sufficiently with these and other regulations, it could negatively impact our ability to continue to develop, distribute and \ndeliver certain of our healthcare products and services, and we could suffer fines or penalties.\nOur sales to local, state, federal and foreign government customers expose us to business volatility and risks, including government \nbudgeting cycles and appropriations, government shutdowns, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early \ntermination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.   We derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. \ngovernment, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws relating to the award, \nadministration and performance of those contracts.\nGovernmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services. Changes in government \nprocurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth \nin the government sector. For example, the U.S. government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirements, including, for example, the \nFedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. These \nrequirements may impact our lines of business in the U.S. federal government market. Compliance with these cybersecurity \nrequirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet, or delays in meeting, the required security controls could limit our ability to \nsell products and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal and state government entities that implement similar \ncybersecurity requirements.\nWe are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any \ntime for a variety of reasons, including without cause. For example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our \ngovernment contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, or for default based on our performance. U.S. federal, state and local \ngovernment and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizations/appropriations. Contracts \nmay also be terminated due to a lack of government funds.",
  "may also be terminated due to a lack of government funds.\nThere is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending as \ngovernments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs. In \naddition, an extended federal government shutdown in the U.S. could cause delays in approvals and decision making, which could \nnegatively impact our results of operations.\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n57/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nGovernment contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If \nviolations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of \ncontracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment \nfrom future government business.\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and \ncosts.   Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the \nenvironment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these operations, human health and safety, the use of certain \nchemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Regulatory, market, \ncarbon tax and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also \ngrow.\nApproximately half of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Waste \nElectrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China\u2019s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by \nElectronic Information Products and the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, among others, may increase our cost of doing \nbusiness internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental \nlegislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental \nand other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud \noperations, insurance premiums and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, \nchange our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these \nlaws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into \none or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of our cloud and \nhardware businesses. \nThe Nomination and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and periodically reviews our environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) programs, including environmental sustainability. We also have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) \ncomprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our \noverall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the \npotential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, including service delivery and \nsupport, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, \nor brand reputation. Any failure to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial \nperformance and growth.\nWe publish an annual Social Impact Report, which includes disclosure of our ESG matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, \nand standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By electing to \nset and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives and \nactivities.\nFurther, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, \nhuman capital and diversity, some of which require specific, target-driven frameworks or disclosure requirements, are being \ndeveloped, formalized and implemented in many jurisdictions. Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures, \nare complex and evolving, and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure \nstandards could impose significant compliance costs. In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our \nprevious ESG-related disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and \nstandards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects.\nFinancial Risks\nOur operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a \nnumber of factors.   Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues,",
  "can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the \nlatter part of a quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue \nshortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability.

If we lose one or more of our key customers for any reason, or we experience a delay \nin even a small number of these large transactions, our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability could fall significantly short of our \npredictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic or political activity may cause our sales forecasts to be \ninaccurate.\nIn addition, we hold a portfolio of publicly traded equity investments and privately held debt and equity investments, including \ninvestments in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a privately held related party entity in which we had an ownership interest \nof approximately 29% as of May 31, 2024. Any impairment charges and effect of changes in the fair values of certain of these \ninvestments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses as a component of consolidated net income in each period. The timing and \namount of impairment charges or changes in fair value, if any, of these investments depends on factors beyond our control, including \nthe perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, and are also subject to the general conditions of \npublic and private equity markets, which are uncertain and have in the past varied, and may in the future vary, materially by period. \nChanges in the fair values of these investments, including Ampere, have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to volatility in \nour net income that is not reflective of our core businesses. The amount of our investments in Ampere could increase in future \nperiods for a variety of reasons, including due to the potential exercise of put options by our co-investors or call options by us. If \neither of these options are exercised by us or our co-investors, we would acquire control of Ampere and its results would be \nconsolidated with our results of operations. Ampere has generated net losses in the past and we currently expect such entity to \ngenerate net losses in future periods that we may need to consolidate into our results of operations in future periods.\nChanges in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability.   We conduct a \nsignificant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign \ncurrencies, particularly the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and \nSaudi Riyal, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are \nreported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and \nmost other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. \nDollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as \ncertain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, \ncurrency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported \nrevenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively \naffected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens \nrelative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign \ncurrencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany \nagreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period \nincurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with \ncertain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As part of this program, we enter into foreign \ncurrency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or \nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency \ntransaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to \nrealize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward \ncontracts, including the cost to obtain such contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain",
  "instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should \nwe suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations \nwill generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated \nwith these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these \nexposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our \nresults of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n61/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nWe have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies \nrelative to the U.S. Dollar. We could incur future losses in emerging market countries and other countries where we do business \nshould their currencies become designated as highly inflationary. \nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.   As of May 31, 2024, we had an aggregate of $86.9 billion \nof outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2024 and calendar year 2061. Our ability to pay interest and \nrepay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash \nflows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. There can be no assurance that we will be able \nto manage any of these risks successfully.\nWe expect to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing \ndebt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest \nrates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to \nthat refinanced indebtedness would increase.\nShould we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal \nincome tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes \nto our outlook or credit rating or a withdrawal by any rating agency could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity \nsecurities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our \nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.   All of the factors discussed within this Risk \nFactors section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding \nnew cloud services, products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our \nstock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of stock repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Our stock price \ncould also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social \nmedia and the analyst community; changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts; changes in \ninvestors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock; negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys; earnings announcements \nwhere our financial results differ from our guidance or investors\u2019 expectations; our credit ratings; dissemination of inaccurate \ninformation or misinformation about our business and results of operations (including through the malicious use of generative AI \ntools); and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in \nparticular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the \noperating performance of those companies. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class \naction lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect \nour business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder \nvalue.   Our repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or \ndollar value of shares.

Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or \nthe curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT \nbudgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause \ncustomers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services. If any parties with whom we conduct \nbusiness or invest our cash or cash equivalents are unable to meet their obligations to us, our business could be adversely affected. \nBank failures or issues in the broader U.S. or global financial systems may have an impact on the broader capital markets and, in turn, \nour ability to access those markets.\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and \nthe potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises and natural disasters continue to contribute to a \nclimate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including \nour revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise \nlicense, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our \nsubscription-based cloud offerings.\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.   A significant portion of our critical business operations are \nconcentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable \nrelative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of \nour systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud \nofferings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back-office processes. Although the \nOracle Cloud is designed to automatically redirect traffic to an alternate facility, in the event of a severe impact to one facility, a major \nnatural disaster, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the \neffects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of \nany of our critical business operations, supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business \noperations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. \nItem 1C. Cybersecurity \nOur overall information security risk management approach is designed to enable us to assess, identify and manage major risk \nexposures, including from material risks from cybersecurity threats, in a timely manner. As part of our information security risk \nmanagement program, we perform risk assessments in which we map and prioritize information security risks identified through the \nprocesses described below. These assessments inform our information security risk management strategies and oversight processes \nand we view cybersecurity risks as one of the key risk categories we face.\nWe believe that Oracle is a target for computer hackers, cyber threats and other bad actors because our products and services store, \nretrieve, process and manage large amounts of data, including sensitive data. We and our vendors are regularly subject to attempts by \nthird parties to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain \nunauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019, partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. \nDuring fiscal 2024, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity \nincidents, that have materially affected us, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

Refer to \u201cData Privacy, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property \nRisks\u201d in Risk Factors included in Item 1A within this Annual Report for additional discussion of the challenges we encounter with \nrespect to cybersecurity risks.\nOur corporate security and information security programs are designed to help us prevent, prepare for, detect, respond to and \nrecover from cybersecurity threats. We leverage industry standard security frameworks to evaluate our security controls. Relevant \npersonnel collaborate with subject matter experts throughout the process to identify and assess material cybersecurity threats, \nevaluate their severity, and explore ways to mitigate a potential security incident. We continually conduct security and privacy reviews \nto pinpoint risks associated with our products, services and enterprise. We also employ various monitoring tools to track suspicious or \nanomalous activity across our networks, systems, and data, and we simulate cyber threats to proactively address vulnerabilities. \nFinally, we routinely train our employees on cybersecurity matters.\nThis program includes processes for triaging, assessing the severity of, escalating, containing, investigating and remediating \ninformation security events, as well as meeting legal obligations and minimizing customer impact and brand and reputational damage. \nIn addition, we maintain insurance to protect against potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. Periodic tabletop exercises \nare conducted to test and reinforce our incident response controls, with incident severity and priority assessed on an ongoing basis.\nWe also conduct external and internal risk management audits to assess and report on our internal incident response preparedness \nand help identify areas for continued focus and improvement. We conduct periodic penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in \nour products, services, and systems. We also undergo security-related industry certifications and attestations by external auditors, \nincluding System and Organization Controls (SOC) 1, SOC 2, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001, 27017 and \n27018, Cloud Security Alliance Security Trust Assurance and Risk (CSA STAR), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) \nand other compliance frameworks. Additionally, our vendor risk management program identifies and mitigates risks associated with \nthird-party service providers, including those within our supply chain and those with access to our customer or employee data or \nsystems. We use the findings from these and other processes to review our information security practices, procedures and \ntechnologies.\nCybersecurity is an important area of focus for our Board of Directors. Our information security risk management program is designed \nto allow our Board of Directors to establish a mutual understanding with management of the effectiveness of our information security \nrisk management practices and capabilities, including the division of responsibilities for reviewing our information security risk \nexposure and risk tolerance, tracking emerging information risks and ensuring proper escalation of certain key risks for periodic \nreview by the Board of Directors and its committees. As part of its broader risk oversight activities, the Board of Directors oversees \nrisks from cybersecurity risks, both directly and through the Finance and Audit Committee (F&A Committee). As reflected in its \ncharter, the F&A Committee assists the Board of Directors with the management and assessment of privacy and data security risk and \nis responsible for reviewing and discussing with management privacy and data security risk exposures, including, among other things, \nthe potential impacts of those exposures on our business, financial results, operations and reputation. The F&A Committee also \noversees our internal controls over financial reporting, including with respect to financial reporting-related information systems.\nAs an element of its information security risk management oversight activities, the F&A Committee reviews the results of our incident \nresponse control tests, external and internal audits and penetration testing and oversees our vendor risk management program. The \nF&A Committee also receives quarterly updates regarding cybersecurity matters from senior management, including Mr. Screven, our \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Corporate Architect (Chief Corporate Architect). In turn, the F&A Committee reports to the full \nBoard of Directors on a quarterly basis regarding the F&A Committee\u2019s cybersecurity risk oversight activities. We also have Board",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\n\u2022\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including \nOracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-\nbased, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual \nin nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the \ncustomer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise \nlicenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license \ntransactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for \nlicense transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license \nsupport revenues in which revenues are recognized over time. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the \noption to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies \nare important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure \ntechnologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, \nwe have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license \nsupport to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. \nThe proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud \nservices revenues represented 37%, 32% and 25% of our total revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nOur cloud and license business\u2019 revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business \nconditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with \nour offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; \nsubstantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of \nlicense support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud \nservices sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and \nforeign currency rate fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\n\u2022\nexpected growth in our cloud services offerings; and\n\u2022\ncontinued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business\u2019 total revenues, which should enable us \nto continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of \nand expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\nOur cloud and license business\u2019 margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal \nyear due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business\u2019 revenues over those quarterly periods and because the \nmajority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license \nbusiness\u2019 revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud \nservices and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon \ncustomer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers\u2019 cloud services and license support \ncontracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward \ntrend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each \ncase over those four fiscal quarterly periods.\n40\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n75/194",

We expect to continue to make investments in research and \ndevelopment to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority \nof our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our \nhardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the \nfunctionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product \nrepairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option \nof the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues \nratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license \nbusiness due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including \ndirect materials and labor costs. \nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins \nthat we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners\u2019 abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few \nlarge hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer \ndemand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; \ngovernmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to \nthe time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; \nand the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as \nhardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed \ntechnologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nServices Business \nOur services business, which represented 10% and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, helps customers \nand partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that \nour services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property \nand best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower \nmargins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our \nstrategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the \nrelated services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental \nbudgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers\u2019 IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; \nand foreign currency rate fluctuations. \nAcquisitions\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested \nbillions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We acquired certain \ncompanies and technologies during fiscal 2024 and 2023, including Cerner in fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated \nFinancial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information related to our acquisition of Cerner and our \nother recent acquisitions.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nopportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate \nstrategy.\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \nbalances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the \nfinancial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital \ntargets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nInvestment in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC\nFrom time to time since 2017, we have made investments in Ampere, a related party entity, in the form of equity and convertible debt \ninstruments. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere, after accounting for losses under the equity method of \naccounting, was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We currently expect Ampere to continue to \ngenerate net losses in future periods but we remain confident in the long-term potential of Ampere\u2019s server chips. \nOur equity investments in Ampere represent an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. We also own \nconvertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in \nJune 2026 and are convertible into equity securities at the holder\u2019s option under certain circumstances. During the fiscal year ended \nMay 31, 2024, we invested an aggregate of $600 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. In accordance with the \nterms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call \n(exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $400 million to $1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity \ninterests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027. If either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we \nwould obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Estimates \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which \nrequires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, \nrevenues, expenses, and related disclosure. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of \nestimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of \noperations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information \navailable to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences \nbetween these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We have critical \naccounting estimates in the areas of business combinations, income taxes and non-marketable investments. Refer to Note 1 of Notes \nto Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more discussion of our significant accounting \npolicies.\nBusiness Combinations\nIn accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, we use our best estimates \nand assumptions, which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement, to recognize and measure assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed, including intangible assets and pre-acquisition contingencies, at the acquisition date as well as any contingent \nconsideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been \nreasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the \nacquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or \nvalidity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year \nfrom the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding \noffset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition\u2019s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets \nacquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of \noperations.\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n78/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our \nreview and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient \ninformation to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.\nIf we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the \nmeasurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such \npre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the \namount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net \nasset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings \nand could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as \nof the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition \ndate with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. \nSubsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\u2019s or contingency\u2019s estimated value, whichever \ncomes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in \nour consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nIncome Taxes \nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many \ntransactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of \nrevenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and \nexpenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid \ndouble taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different \nfrom that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our \nincome tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order \nfor us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the \ndeferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the \njurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and \nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine \nthat we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets \nvaluation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be \nadjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later \ndetermine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of \nthe previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such time.\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results \nreflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the \nperiod when the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in \nproposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nFor those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant \nto ASC 740, Income Taxes, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or \nexpected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely \nthan not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The \nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. \nAlthough we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the \nfinal outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as \nthe closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our \nestimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally \nwill impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes \ninclude the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest \nand penalties.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nWe assess our non-marketable debt and equity investments for credit losses and impairment on a quarterly basis and as facts and \ncircumstances change. Our analysis includes an assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee\u2019s \nhistorical financial results, current financial projections, rate of cash usage and assumptions regarding product acceptance and \nopportunity within the market. This analysis requires significant judgment in evaluating underlying factors. In some instances, investee \nspecific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is \ndetermined to be impaired, we adjust the carrying amount of such investment to its estimated fair value by recognizing a charge, \nwhich is included in non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Estimating the fair value of an \ninvestment upon impairment involves a significant level of estimation, uncertainty and judgment. We may incur future losses due to \nimpairments, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nResults of Operations\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information \nIn our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating \nexpenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based \ndiscussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are \nnot directly attributable to our three businesses.\nIn addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses\u2014cloud and license, hardware and services\u2014which are our \noperating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is \npresented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below \nreflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three \nbusinesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion \nbelow.\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative \nexpenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition \nrelated and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes are \nnot attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses \nincluding such items and/or it is impracticable to do so.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of each of our businesses\u2019 \nrevenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses\u2019 revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue \nto be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how \nour underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in \nthe results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency. To present this information, current and \ncomparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant \nexchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2023, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual \nexchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros \nfrom products sold on May 31, 2024 and 2023, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.09 million in fiscal 2024 \n(using 1.09 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period) and $1.08 million in fiscal 2023 (using 1.08 as the applicable \naverage exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 2024 results using the \nfiscal 2023 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues between the periods compared.

Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a \nsubscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, \nhost, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is \ngenerally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-\npremise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database \nand middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized \nup front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are \ntypically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and \non-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the \ncontractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on \ndirect sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs \nassociated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing \nexpenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license \nsupport offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing \nprogram costs.\n47\n(4)\n(5)\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n87/194",

The increase in net cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the absence of the cash proceeds \nfrom borrowings pursuant to the issuance of senior notes and Term Loan Credit Agreement, higher repayments of commercial paper \nnotes, net of issuances, higher net cash used for our employee stock programs and higher dividend payments, partially offset by lower \nmaturities of senior notes and lower stock repurchases, in each case in fiscal 2024 relative to fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2023 we \nborrowed $15.7 billion pursuant to the Bridge Credit Agreement, which was fully repaid within fiscal 2023.\nFree cash flow:   To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows \non a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one \nof the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant \nto be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows \nfrom operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYear Ended May 31,\n\u00a0\n(Dollars in millions)\n\u00a0\n2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nChange\n\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n\u00a0 $\n18,673 \u00a0 \u00a0\n9%\u00a0 $\n17,165 \u00a0\nCapital expenditures\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(6,866 ) \u00a0\n-21%\u00a0 \u00a0\n(8,695 )\nFree cash flow\n\u00a0 $\n11,807 \u00a0 \u00a0\n39%\u00a0 $\n8,470 \u00a0\nNet income\n\u00a0 $\n10,467 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0 $\n8,503 \u00a0\nNet cash provided by operating activities as a percent of net income\n\u00a0\n178% \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n202% \u00a0\nFree cash flow as percent of net income\n\u00a0\n113% \u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n100% \u00a0\n\u00a0\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n100/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nRecent Financing Activities:\nTerm Loan Credit Agreements:  On June 10, 2024, we terminated our existing term loan credit agreement that we entered into in \nfiscal 2023 and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, \nwe borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit \nAgreement) executed on the same date. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will become \nfully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of Term Loan Credit Agreement is extended. Refer to Note 7 of \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our borrowings.\nCash Dividends:  In fiscal 2024, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.60 per share that totaled $4.4 billion. In June 2024, our \nBoard of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 25, 2024 to \nstockholders of record as of the close of business on July 11, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future \nrecord and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program:   Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common \nstock. As of May 31, 2024, approximately $7.0 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase \nprogram. We repurchased 10.6 million shares for $1.2 billion, 17.0 million shares for $1.3 billion, and 185.8 million shares for $16.2 \nbillion in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace \nof our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and \ndividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. \nOur stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. \nOur stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nContractual Obligations:   Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2024 consisted of:\n\u2022\nprincipal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that were included in our consolidated balance sheet \nand the related periodic interest payments;\n\u2022\nroutine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of \n2017 that were included in our consolidated balance sheet;\n\u2022\noperating lease liabilities that were included in our consolidated balance sheet; \n\u2022\noperating lease commitments that have not yet commenced and were not included in our consolidated balance sheet; and\n\u2022\nother contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2024, we had $11.0 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and \npenalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the \nrelevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released \nduring fiscal 2025. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, \nestimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our \ncontrol. Notes 7, 10, 13 and 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include \nadditional information regarding our most material contractual obligations and contingencies.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our \nborrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. \nIn addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with \nour internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or \nfrom the issuance of additional securities.\n55\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n102/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nStock-Based Awards\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of \nour talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders. \nWe recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards \ngranted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since \nJune 1, 2021 has been an annualized rate of 2.1% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized \nnew stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the \nweighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based \nawards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of May 31, 2024, which generally have a ten-year \nexercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock \nrepurchase program has substantially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify \nthe levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available \nfor acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2024, the maximum \npotential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, \nwas 6.9%.\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to \nselected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of RSUs with a value of $5 million or \ngreater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2024 equity \nbudget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation \nCommittee.\nStock-based awards activity from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2024 is summarized as follows (shares in millions):\n \nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2021\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n217 \u00a0\nStock-based awards granted and assumed\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n195 \u00a0\nStock-based awards vested and issued and, if applicable, exercised\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(195 )\nForfeitures, cancellations and other, net\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(28 )\nStock-based awards outstanding as of May 31, 2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n189 \u00a0\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n56 \u00a0\nAnnualized stock repurchases\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(71 )\nShares outstanding as of May 31, 2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2,755 \u00a0\nBasic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n2,713 \u00a0\nStock-based awards outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2024\n\u00a0\n6.9% \u00a0\nTotal in the money stock-based awards outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day of \nfiscal 2024) as a percent of shares outstanding as of May 31, 2024\n\u00a0\n6.9% \u00a0\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stock repurchases, as a \npercent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2024\n\u00a0\n2.1% \u00a0\nAnnualized stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stock repurchases, as a \npercent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2024\n\u00a0\n-0.6% \u00a0\n\u00a0\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated \nfinancial statements, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nItem 7A.

Our non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the equity method, and convertible debt investments \nin privately owned companies, primarily in a related party entity, generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes. However, \nthese investments could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value and is not expected to recover. The timing and \namounts of changes in fair values of our non-marketable equity investments depend on factors beyond our control, including the \nperceived and actual performance of the companies in which we invest. For additional disclosure regarding the impact to our \nquarterly results of operations from investment volatility, please refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual \nReport. For additional details on our non-marketable investments, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included \nelsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCurrency Risk \nForeign Currency Translation Risk \nAs described under \u201cConstant Currency Presentation\u201d above, our international operations have provided and are expected to \ncontinue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our \nconsolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign \ncurrencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for \nour foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In \nparticular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash \nequivalents, trade receivables, total revenues and total expenses that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated \nfinancial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk \nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany \ntransactions. Our principal currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen and \nSaudi Riyal. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset the risks that \narise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for \nmajor currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or \nlosses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency \ntransactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in \nduration and we do not use them for trading purposes.\nRealized gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward \ncontracts, including costs incurred to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, are included in non-operating expenses or \nincome, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will \ngenerally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with \nthese exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. \nFurthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency \nvolatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, \nincluding our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of May 31, 2024 based on the guidelines established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the \nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\u2019s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial reporting \nincludes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation \nof financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as \nof May 31, 2024.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by \nparagraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are \nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and \ninternal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at \nthe reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our \ninternal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-conceived and \noperated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design \nof a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to \ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all \ncontrol issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in \ndecision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be \ncircumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. \nThe design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there \ncan be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls \nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be \ndetected.\n59\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n109/194",

In our \nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2024 \nand 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, in conformity \nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated \nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated June \n20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \nCompany\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our \naudits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or \nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the \namounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant \nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits \nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to \nthe financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical \naudit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to \nwhich it relates.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIncome Tax \u2013 Uncertain tax positions\nDescription of \nthe matter\n\u00a0\nAs discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes uncertain tax positions and \nmeasures unrecognized tax benefits related to various domestic and foreign matters. The Company uses significant \njudgment in the accounting for uncertain tax positions related to certain revenue sharing and cost reimbursement \narrangements, including the interpretation and application of tax laws and legal rulings in various jurisdictions.\nAuditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and \nthe measurement of the benefit of uncertain tax positions related to certain revenue sharing and cost reimbursement \narrangements was complex, involved significant judgment, and was based on interpretations and application of tax \nlaws and legal rulings. \n62\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n112/194",

We involved our tax subject matter professionals in assessing the technical merits of \nthese positions and used our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities.

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited Oracle Corporation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal \nControl\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \nCOSO criteria). In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial \nreporting as of May 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, \ncomprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, and the \nrelated notes and our report dated June 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the \neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over \nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance \nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, \ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other \nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide \nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, \nor that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nSan Jose, California \nJune 20, 2024\n64\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n114/194",

We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a \nvariety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments \n(an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud based deployments). Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Oracle Cloud \nInfrastructure (SaaS and OCI, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated \napplications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. \nCustomers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own \ncloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support \ncontracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the \nsupport period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase \nhardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, \nand technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer \nutilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to \noperations originally begun in June 1977.\nBasis of Financial Statements\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. \nNoncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity \nfrom the equity attributable to Oracle\u2019s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were \nnot significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead \nare included as a component of non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions \nand balances have been eliminated. The comparability of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended May 31, \n2022 was impacted by $4.7 billion of certain litigation related charges during fiscal 2022.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we finalized our adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, Reference Rate \nReform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequent amendments to the \ninitial guidance, which had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto for the year ended May 31, \n2024.\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles \n(GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider \nvarious staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make \ncertain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are \nreasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These \nestimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial \nstatements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are \ndifferences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be \naffected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n123/194",

There are also areas in which management\u2019s \njudgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimate of the \nuseful lives from four years to five years effective at the beginning of fiscal 2023. Based on the carrying value of our servers as of May \n31, 2022, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $434 million during fiscal 2023.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur sources of revenues include:\n\u2022\ncloud and license revenues, which include: cloud services revenues; cloud license and on-premise license revenues; and \nlicense support revenues, which typically represent perpetual software licenses purchased by customers for use in both \ncloud and on-premise IT environments; \n\u2022\nhardware revenues, which include the sale of hardware products, including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, and storage \nproducts, and industry-specific hardware; and hardware support revenues; and \n\u2022\nservices revenues, which are earned from providing cloud-, license- and hardware-related services including consulting and \nadvanced customer services.\nCloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which deliver applications and infrastructure \ntechnologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements \nfor, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a \nstated period.\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use \nour database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise \nand other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support \ncontracts, which are entered into at the customer\u2019s option. \nLicense support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-\npremise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified \nsoftware product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet \naccess to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are \ngenerally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to \npurchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, \ncomputer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings generally provide customers with software \nupdates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include \nproduct repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a \npercentage of the net hardware products fees.\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products \nand services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and \nsecure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to \nprovide supplemental support services, performance services and higher availability for Oracle products and services. \n71\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n125/194",
  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) as a single standard for revenue recognition \nthat applies to all of our cloud, license, hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon \nthe transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers, reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to \nreceive for those goods or services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps:\n\u2022\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\ndetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and \n\u2022\nrecognition of revenues when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of \nmany sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is \nincluded within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record \ndeferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an \ninvoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and \nhardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the \nhardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS \nand cloud infrastructure contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in \nadvance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our \nOracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to \nreflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating expenses, net within our \nconsolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and \noperate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are \nexpected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered \nproducts or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to \ngovernmental authorities.\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Services\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the \ncloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because \nthe customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services \nthat are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services \nby the customer. \n72\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n126/194",
  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nRevenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support\nOracle\u2019s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide \ncustomers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during \nthe term of the support period, if and when they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to \nmake the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for \nlicense support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the \nsupport services are provided.\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in \ntime when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements \nfor distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For \nusage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront \nwhen the software is made available to the royalty customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Hardware Products\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and \nare accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally \nrecognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Services \nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally \nrecognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are \ngenerally recognized as the services are performed.\nAllocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations \nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance \nobligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; \ntherefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each \nperformance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract. \nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses \nand on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in \ncomparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed \non a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been \nsold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud \nlicense and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the \ncustomer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable \nprices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative \nSSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise \nlicense included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby \nall other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective \nSSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues.\n73\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n127/194",
  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nRemaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues \nin our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, \n2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was \napproximately $9.0 billion and $8.3 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and \nimpairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; \ninvoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will \nbe invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total \nrevenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting \nactivity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These seasonal \nimpacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate \nfluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of \nMay 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as \nrevenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to \nmonth 60 and the remainder thereafter.\nSales of Financing Receivables\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through \nseparate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse \nbasis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts\u2019 dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from \ncustomers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these \nfinancing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing \nreceivables were sold to financial institutions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we \nevaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an \nintegrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to \ninvestors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed \non a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets \nacquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the \nexcess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. \nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business \nacquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to \nrefinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record \nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a \nbusiness acquisition\u2019s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever \ncomes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure \ncertain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC \n420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated \nwith an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period \nin which the liability is incurred.\n74\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n128/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our \nreview and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient \ninformation to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax \nrelated pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such \nmatters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a \nliability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. \nSubsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes \nfirst, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations \nand financial position.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as \nof the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business \nacquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement \nperiod. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance\u2019s or contingency\u2019s estimated value, \nwhichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for \nincome taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial \nposition.\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Investments \nIn accordance with ASC 320, Investments\u2014Debt Securities, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify \nsubstantially all of our marketable debt securities investments as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report \nthe unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders\u2019 equity, except for any unrealized losses determined to \nbe related to credit losses, which we record within non-operating expenses, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of \noperations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. All of our marketable debt \nsecurities investments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current \noperations.\nInvestments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at their fair values, if the fair \nvalues are readily determinable. Non-marketable equity securities for which the fair values are not readily determinable and where \nwe do not have control of, nor significant influence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable \nprice changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a \ncomponent of non-operating expenses, net as of and for each reporting period. For equity investments through which we have \nsignificant influence in, but not control of, the investee, we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting \nwhereby we record our proportionate share of the investee\u2019s earnings or losses; amortization of differences between our investment \nbasis and underlying equity in net assets of the investee, excluding component representing goodwill; and impairment, if any, as a \ncomponent of non-operating expenses, net for each reporting period.\nOur investments in non-marketable debt instruments are recorded at cost plus accrued interest, adjusted for any provision for \nexpected credit losses.\nOur investments in marketable debt and equity securities totaled $207 million and $422 million as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, \nrespectively, and are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nOur non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion as of May 31, \n2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are \nsubject to periodic impairment reviews. The majority of the non-marketable investments held as of these dates were with Ampere \nComputing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity in which we had an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of May 31,",

During the fiscal year ended \nMay 31, 2024, we invested an aggregate of $600 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. The total carrying value of \nour investments in Ampere after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion as of \nMay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a \ncounterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $400 \nmillion to $1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027. If \neither of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our \nresults of operations. Ampere has historically generated net losses.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure \nat fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our \nderivative financial instruments. \nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4. \nAllowances for Credit Losses \nWe record allowances for credit losses based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not \nspecifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated \nwith the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-off a \nreceivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk \nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, \nmarketable securities, derivatives, trade receivables and non-marketable investments. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally \nheld with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. \nInvestment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our \nderivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty \ncredit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be \nreceived or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do \nnot require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we \nperform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the \ndiversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2024, 2023 or \n2022. Refer to \u201cMarketable and Non-Marketable Investments\u201d above for additional information on our non-marketable investments.\nWe outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products that we sell to our \ncustomers as well as use internally to deliver our cloud services to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. \nFurther, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number \nof locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing \npartners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and \nlicense and hardware businesses. \nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities \nand obsolescence.

In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are \nconsidered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent \nchanges in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are \nincluded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $334 million and $298 million \nas of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther Receivables \nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third \nparties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled \n$821 million and $798 million as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDeferred Sales Commissions\nWe defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a \ncloud, license support and hardware support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts \nare generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years. We determine \nthe period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful \nlives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloud-based \narrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is \ngenerally one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses \nin our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales commissions are included in other current assets \nand other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line \nmethod based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from one to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over \nthe lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are \nperiodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may \nnot be recoverable at an appropriate asset or asset group level. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in \nfiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible \nassets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are itemized in Note 6 below and are \namortized over their useful lives, which generally range from one to 10 years. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite \nlived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows. \nThe carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we \nhave the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a \nquantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors considered for a \nreporting unit include: cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity \nspecific factors; industry and market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the \nreporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is \nless than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n134/194",

For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the \ncarrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, \njudgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; \nthe discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and market conditions; and market \ncomparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less \nthan the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill \nrecognized for the reporting unit. Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2024 and did not result \nin a goodwill impairment charge. We did not recognize impairment charges in fiscal 2023 or 2022.\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future \nundiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Recoverability of indefinite \nlived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be \nimpaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired \nasset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We do \nnot use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an \nasset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives\u2019 fair values \nbe recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted \nfor as certain types of hedges). \nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting \ndesignation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is \nrecognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being \nhedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, during each reporting period, we record the change in fair value \nof the derivative to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and the change is reclassified to \nearnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.\nLeases\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 842, Leases (ASC 842), in accounting for our leases. Accordingly, we determine if an arrangement is a \nlease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease \npayments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease \ncommencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not \nknown. Right-of-Use (ROU) assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial \nmeasurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are used in \ndetermining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is \nreasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-\nline basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. We have lease \nagreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease \ncomponent. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year. \nAbandoned operating leases are accounted for as ROU asset impairment charges pursuant to ASC 842.\nROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included \nin other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated",

Note 10 \nbelow provides additional information regarding our leases.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and \nassess our potential financial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a \nbusiness combination are provided under \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d above.

Note 16 below provides additional information \nregarding certain of our legal contingencies.\nForeign Currency\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country\u2019s \ncurrency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average \nexchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the \nbalance sheet dates.

Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating expenses, net \nin the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $228 million, $249 million and $199 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 and \n2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation \nWe account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, service-\nbased employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in \naccordance with ASC 718, Compensation\u2014Stock Compensation, which requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are \ncompensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of \nstock-based awards as they occur. \nFor our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period \nof the award, which is generally four years.\nFor our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for tranches that are probable of achievement \nover the longer of the (a) estimated implicit service period for performance-metric achievement or (b) derived service period for \nmarket-based metric achievement applicable for each tranche. During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based \ncompensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected \nattainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our \nestimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim \nreporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are \nreflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis \nduring each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are \nrecognized prospectively. \nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns \nbased on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested \nportion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are \nable to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these \njurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised \nwith any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established, and recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision \nfor \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n138/194",

In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we \nrecorded approximately $18.6 billion of goodwill, $12.0 billion of identifiable intangible assets and $2.4 billion of net tangible \nliabilities. Goodwill recognized as a part of our acquisition of Cerner was not deductible for income tax purposes.\nOther Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 Acquisitions \nDuring fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets \nprimarily to expand our products and services offerings.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from \nselling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When \ndetermining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the \nprincipal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use \nwhen pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. \nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of \nunobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset\u2019s or a liability\u2019s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon \nthe lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used \nto measure fair value: \n\u2022\nLevel 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\u2022\nLevel 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for \nsimilar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other \ninputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or \nliabilities; or \n\u2022\nLevel 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the \nassets or liabilities.\n82\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n143/194",

In fiscal 2022 and \n2024, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and \nRestated 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the 2020 Plan and, together with the 2000 Plan, the Plans), which \nincreased the number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued under the 2020 Plan by 300 million shares and 350 million \nshares, respectively. Approximately 457 million shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of \nMay 31, 2024. Under the 2020 Plan, for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a RSU or a performance-based \nrestricted stock award, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.\nAs of May 31, 2024, 134 million unvested RSUs, 38 million PSOs (of which 11 million shares were vested) and service-based stock \noptions (SOs) to purchase 13 million shares of common stock, substantially all of which were vested, were outstanding under the \nPlans. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.\nThe vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the \nCompensation Committee). RSUs generally require service-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. SOs were previously \ngranted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, \nand generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.\nPSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven \nnumerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially could vest. One tranche, which was based solely on the attainment of a \nmarket-based metric, was achieved and vested in fiscal 2022. Each of the remaining six tranches requires the attainment of both a \nperformance metric and a market capitalization metric by May 31, 2022, which was subsequently extended by three additional fiscal \nyears to May 31, 2025 via an amendment approved by the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2022. The Compensation \nCommittee has certified that all six market capitalization goals have been achieved. One operational performance goal was achieved \nin fiscal 2023 and consequently, the first of the remaining six tranches vested in fiscal 2024. One operational performance goal was \nachieved in fiscal 2024, but the Compensation Committee has not yet certified the achievement of this performance goal and the \nsecond of the remaining six tranches is therefore not yet vested as of May 31, 2024. If any of the remaining operational performance \ngoals are achieved before May 31, 2025, additional tranches may vest, assuming continued employment and service through the date \nthe Compensation Committee certifies that performance has been achieved. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized \nstarting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or \nderived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be \nprobable is \n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n158/194",

We have \nestimated remaining service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement as of May 31, 2024 to be \none year.\nIn connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under \neach acquired company\u2019s respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted \nstock-based awards and stock options assumed or substituted generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the \nrespective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2024, approximately 520,000 unvested RSUs and stock \noptions to purchase approximately 257,000 shares of common stock, substantially all of which were vested, were outstanding under \nacquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.\nThe 1993 Directors\u2019 Stock Plan (the Directors\u2019 Plan) provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-\nqualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors\u2019 Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the \nterms of the Directors\u2019 Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to \nincrease the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). Currently, we only grant RSUs that vest \nfully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. In fiscal 2016, the Directors\u2019 Plan was amended to permit the Compensation \nCommittee to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first \nbecoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to \ncertain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors\u2019 Plan. In fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the \nmaximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each non-employee director to $350,000 and eliminated all equity grants for \nchairing Board committees. As of May 31, 2024, approximately 36,000 unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately \n92,000 shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors\u2019 Plan. As of May 31, 2024, \napproximately 1 million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans for our last three \nfiscal years ended May 31, 2024:\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRestricted Stock-Based Awards Outstanding\n\u00a0\n(in millions, except fair value)\n\u00a0\nNumber of\nShares\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair Value\n\u00a0\nBalance, May 31, 2021\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n110 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n51.87 \u00a0\nGranted\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n65 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n85.07 \u00a0\nVested and issued\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(38 ) \u00a0\n$\n50.52 \u00a0\nCanceled\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(9 ) \u00a0\n$\n63.25 \u00a0\nBalance, May 31, 2022\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n128 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n68.34 \u00a0\nGranted\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n76 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n66.67 \u00a0\nAssumed\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n5 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n69.02 \u00a0\nVested and issued\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(46 ) \u00a0\n$\n62.97 \u00a0\nCanceled\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(11 ) \u00a0\n$\n69.25 \u00a0\nBalance, May 31, 2023\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n152 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n69.09 \u00a0\nGranted\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n47 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n110.26 \u00a0\nVested and issued\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(53 ) \u00a0\n$\n66.97 \u00a0\nCanceled\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(8 ) \u00a0\n$\n77.52 \u00a0\nBalance, May 31, 2024\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n138 \u00a0 \u00a0\n$\n83.43 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe total grant date fair values of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $3.5 \nbillion, $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and \nstock options that were exercised was $7.4 billion, $5.1 billion and $3.7 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. In connection with the \nvesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $1.7 \nbillion, $1.2 billion and $843 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per \nshare that is 95% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2024, 35 \nmillion shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued approximately 2 million shares in each of fiscal \n2024, 2023 and 2022 under the Purchase Plan.\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans \nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $468 \nmillion, $470 million and $412 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). \nParticipants can generally contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle \n401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of \nemployee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. \nOur contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $200 million, $198 million and $164 million in fiscal 2024, 2023 \nand 2022, respectively.\nWe also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base \nand/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred \ncompensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $988 million and approximately $792 million as of May 31, 2024 \nand 2023, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying \nconsolidated balance sheets.\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans \nwere assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with \ninsurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as \napplicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $71 million, $78 million and $67 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and \n2022, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status, which is substantially \nincluded in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2024 were $997 \nmillion and $313 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2023 were $939 million and $322 million, respectively.\n13.\nINCOME TAXES \nOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income and losses earned in various tax \njurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. \nfederal statutory income tax rate for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. \nresearch and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign \nDerived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income.\n96\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n164/194",

With some \nexceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.\nWe are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax \nmatters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, \nEgypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy \nare significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and \naccrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final \noutcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will \nnot have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the \nreversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. \nIf our estimates of the federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, \nit could result in a further charge to expense.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits.

The consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former \nmember of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary \nduties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. at an excessive price. The complaint sought (and the operative complaint \ncontinues to seek) declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest) and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The defendants \nfiled a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 2018.\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n5/25/25, 1:44 PM\n10-K\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm\n176/194",

  "Table of Contents\nIndex to Financial Statements\n\u00a0\nOn May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative \naction. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC \nbelieved that plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board \nthat it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the SLC\u2019s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority \nto respond to discovery requests in the litigation.\nAfter plaintiff filed the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiff joined the case. Plaintiffs filed several amended complaints, and \nfiled their most recent amended complaint on December 11, 2020. The final complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty \nagainst our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief Executive Officer who \npassed away on October 18, 2019) and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. On \nDecember 11, 2020, the estate of Mark Hurd and the two other members of our Board of Directors moved to dismiss this complaint. \nOn June 21, 2021, the court granted this motion as to the estate of Mark Hurd and one Board member and denied the motion as to \nthe other Board member, who filed an answer to the complaint on August 9, 2021. On December 28, 2020, our Chief Executive \nOfficer, our Chief Technology Officer and Oracle as a nominal defendant filed answers to the operative complaint.\nTrial commenced on July 18, 2022, and on November 18, 2022, the court held a final hearing on the parties\u2019 post-trial briefing. On \nDecember 27, 2022, the court \u201cso ordered\u201d a stipulation, dismissing the Board member from this action. On May 12, 2023, the court \nissued its trial ruling, finding for defendants and rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The court entered judgment for defendants on March 5, \n2024. On April 2, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, appealing the court\u2019s trial ruling and judgment and certain discovery \ndecisions relating to the SLC. On May 2, 2024, plaintiffs filed their opening appellate brief. On June 3, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer \nand Chief Technology Officer filed their opposition brief, and the SLC filed an opposition brief on the discovery issues. Plaintiffs\u2019 reply \nis due on June 25, 2024. No hearing date has been set.\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our financial position \nor results of operations.\nDerivative Litigation Concerning Oracle\u2019s Cloud Business\nOn February 12 and May 6, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of \nCalifornia. The cases were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a single plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated \ncomplaint brought various claims relating to a Rule 10b-5 class action that was filed in the same court on August 10, 2018, and which \nwas settled for a payment by Oracle of $17,500,000. That matter is now concluded. In the Rule 10b-5 class action, plaintiff alleged \nOracle and certain Oracle officers made or were responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle\u2019s cloud business.\nPlaintiff in the derivative action filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder \nof Oracle, purportedly on Oracle\u2019s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Executive Officer and the estate of Mark \nHurd. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the 10b-5 class action caused harm to Oracle, including harming Oracle \nbecause Oracle allegedly repurchased its own stock at an inflated price. Plaintiff also claims that defendants violated their fiduciary \nduties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for \nviolations of federal securities laws. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants \nare liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an award of damages to Oracle, an order directing defendants to enact corporate \nreforms, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and unspecified relief. Beginning on June 14, 2021, the court \u201cso ordered\u201d several stipulations from \nthe parties, staying this case. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this case, under which Oracle will \nimplement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for five years, and Oracle will pay plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 \nfees and costs of no more than $700,000. On April 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed",
