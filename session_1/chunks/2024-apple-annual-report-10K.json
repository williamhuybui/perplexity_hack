  "Services\nAdvertising\nThe Company\u2019s advertising services include third-party licensing arrangements and the Company\u2019s own advertising platforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare  brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\naccidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company\u2019s cloud services store and keep customers\u2019 content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as\nbooks, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+\n, a\npersonalized fitness service; Apple Music , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ , a subscription news\nand magazine service; and Apple TV+ , which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay , a cashless payment service.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\nCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024,\nthe Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the\nCompany\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nSM\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\n\u00ae\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2",
  "The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\nas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines,\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\n(\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This\nincludes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and",
  "registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the\nCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3",
  "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to\ncreate an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September\u00a028, 2024,\nthe Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The\nCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and\ntime away.\nGrowth and Development\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on\nleadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical\nand personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\nemployees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 4",

When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency\nfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In\naddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions\ncan have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel\npartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\nand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5",
  "The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural\ndisasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and\nother business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics\nproviders, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly\nsignificant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant\nsupply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and\ncan require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and\ndistribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company\u2019s business and supply chain in accordance with new\nor changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be\nannounced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such\nmeasures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the\nCompany\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring\nmore frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity\nattacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and\ngeopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the\nCompany\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively\nimpact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.",
  "Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and\nlose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business\ninterruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.

  "Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these\ninvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes\nwith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and\nservices to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services\nthat compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with",

  "The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often\nin single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating\ncosts, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have\nan adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from\ntime to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\nand can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nChanges or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure\nto additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or\nat all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a\nparticular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the\nCompany remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these",
  "components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.

  "The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of\nhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects\ncould make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\nCompany\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety\nrisks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect\nand fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues\naffecting the Company\u2019s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a\nuser\u2019s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory,\nproperty, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems\ncan adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive\nadvantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds\nnet realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or\nat all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.",
  "Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms.

If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy\nthe Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger\nmarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated\nwithin an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation,\ncompetition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the\nCompany has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store\nregarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.

Changes to the Company\u2019s products and services could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in\nthe rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can\nbe for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is\nvigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\nfrequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its\nbusiness practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film\nand digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,\nincluding electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by\nincreasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the\nCompany\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s business or",
  "supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These\nrisks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as\nthe Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical\nconsiderations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies\nand procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13",
  "Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the\nCompany may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating\nto the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory\nrequirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the\nCompany\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the Company\u2019s\nannounced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the\nCompany\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition,\nsome stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its\ninitiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet\nevolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented\nchanges to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing\nmechanisms.\nThe Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business\nterms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for\napps across the Company\u2019s operating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its\ncompliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s compliance plan is\nintended to address the DMA\u2019s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for\nsignificant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes\nintroduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and\nclaims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets\nfor \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe",
  "and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be\nexposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and\nlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing\narrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these\narrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n \nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14",
  "There can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations\nor in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely\naffect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various\ntypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the\nCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\nrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business\npractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data\nis handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to\nlitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,\nthe Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry\ndata security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment\ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or",
  "in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, supply or\nmanufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15",
  "The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the\npast been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future\nfluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\ntrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and\navoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries",
  "are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16",
  "The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\nits stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the\n\u201cBoard\u201d), and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations\nrelated to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly,\nwhich could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cybersecurity\nThe Company\u2019s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing any material\nrisks from cybersecurity threats.

The\nCommission\u2019s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps\ndistributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to\ndefault settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the\nArticle 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\u2019s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation\nagainst the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the\nDMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of\nthe Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales.

The California\nDistrict Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction\nenjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple\nin-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a\nplan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company\u2019s compliance\nplan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the\nCompany filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to\nvigorously defend itself.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial\ncondition or operating results.

Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of\ninternational taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final\noutcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and\ncircumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have\na material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 26",
  "Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate\nSensitive Instrument\nHypothetical Interest\nRate Increase\nPotential Impact\n2024\n2023\nInvestment portfolio\n100 basis points, all tenors\nDecline in fair value\n$\n2,755\u00a0\n$\n3,089\u00a0\nTerm debt\n100 basis points, all tenors\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n$\n139\u00a0\n$\n194\u00a0\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September\u00a0 28, 2024 and September\u00a0 30, 2023, respectively.

  "Note 2 \u2013 Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.\nControl is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or\nservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material\nperformance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale.\nThe second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud , Siri  and Maps. The\nCompany allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks\nobservable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the\ndelivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.\nRevenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be\nprovided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\niPhone\n$\n201,183\u00a0\n$\n200,583\u00a0\n$\n205,489\u00a0\nMac\n29,984\u00a0\n29,357\u00a0\n40,177\u00a0\niPad\n26,694\u00a0\n28,300\u00a0\n29,292\u00a0\nWearables, Home and Accessories\n37,005\u00a0\n39,845\u00a0\n41,241\u00a0\nServices \n96,169\u00a0\n85,200\u00a0\n78,129\u00a0\nTotal net sales\n$\n391,035\u00a0\n$\n383,285\u00a0\n$\n394,328\u00a0\n(1)\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\u00a030, 2023, $8.2 billion of revenue",

Net sales for geographic segments are generally\nbased on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment\nconsists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.

  "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nSeptember\u00a028, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at September\u00a028, 2024 and September\u00a030, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\neach of the three years in the period ended September\u00a028, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September\u00a028, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November\u00a01, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\u00a0 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\u00a0 involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September\u00a028, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was\n$22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for\nsome of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of\nGAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\non interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48",
  "How We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s\nassessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to\nmeasure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.\nWe evaluated the Company\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the\nrelated measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included,\namong others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company\u2019s\ncommunications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\nWe involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax\npositions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain\ntax position, we also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external\nadvisors and the Company\u2019s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosure in relation to these\nmatters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a01, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 49",

In our opinion, Apple\nInc.

Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\u00a0 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember\u00a01, 2024\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50",

The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\u00a0\n(i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s\nassets;\n(ii)\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management\nand directors; and\n(iii)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP.

  "APPLE INC.\n2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD\n1.\nGeneral. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these \u201cTerms\u201d) apply to a particular restricted stock unit\naward (the \u201cAward\u201d) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant\n(the \u201cGrant Notice\u201d) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\n\u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \u201cAward Date.\u201d The Award was granted\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the Award.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an\nunfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \u201cVesting Date.\u201d) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first\nVesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of\nthe Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a\npersonal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the\nCompany, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant\u2019s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant\u2019s other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant\u2019s consent thereto.\n1",
  "5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dividend and Voting Rights.\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i)\u00a0the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii)\u00a0the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that\nare outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a \u201cDividend Equivalent Right\u201d). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the\nforegoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the original\nRSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested Dividend\nEquivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to\nany RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any\ninterest therein or amount or Shares issued in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,\nalienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timing and Manner of Settlement of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following each vesting event pursuant to\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 \u00bd) months after such vesting event), the Company shall deliver to the\nParticipant a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on such vesting event, less Tax-Related Items. The\nCompany\u2019s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person\nentitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents\nor assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are\nsettled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effect of Termination of Service. Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant\u2019s RSUs (as well as\nthe related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant\u2019s\nTermination of Service, meaning the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its\nSubsidiaries (the \u201cSeverance Date\u201d), regardless of the reason for the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause,\nvoluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting\nDate and the Participant will have no right to the terminated RSUs, any underlying Shares or any cash equivalent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nin the event the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service is due to the Participant\u2019s Disability at a time when RSUs remain unvested under the Award,\n(a) the Award shall vest on the Severance Date with respect to the number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights)\ndetermined by multiplying (i)\u00a0 the number of then-outstanding and unvested RSUs subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested\npursuant to Section 3 on the next Vesting Date following the Severance Date but for such Termination of Service, by (ii)\u00a0a fraction, the numerator\nof which shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Vesting Date that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or, in the\ncase of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date,\n2",
  "the Vesting Commencement Date) and the Severance Date, and the denominator of which shall be the number of days between the Vesting\nDate that immediately preceded the Severance Date (or, in the case of a Termination of Service prior to the initial Vesting Date, the Vesting\nCommencement Date) and the next Vesting Date following the Severance Date that would have occurred but for such Termination of Service;\nand (b) any RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are not vested after giving effect to the foregoing clause (a) shall\nterminate on the Severance Date. Further, in the event the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service is due to the Participant\u2019s death, any unvested\nRSUs shall be fully vested as of the Severance Date, and any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited to the Participant shall be paid. If any\nunvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be\ncanceled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the\nParticipant or the Participant\u2019s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be\nissued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of\nany such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, \u201cclawback\u201d or similar provisions of Applicable Laws relevant to the Company\u2019s\nShares and any recoupment, \u201cclawback\u201d or similar policy maintained by the Company from time to time. In addition, the Company may require\nthe Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,\ndelivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such\nShares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant\u2019s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the\n\u201cEmployment Period\u201d), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or\noffense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of\nconfidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the\nCompany or any of its Subsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,\nembezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant\u2019s\nbehalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding the Participant\u2019s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to re-\nconvey, transfer, or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the Participant further agrees\nto comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order to comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the extent\nthat the terms of this Agreement and any Company recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This Section 9 is\nnot the Company\u2019s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company\u2019s stock contemplated by\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of\nthe Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited\npursuant to Section 5(b).\n3",
  "11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant\u2019s\nemployer (\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\nthe Company and/or the Employer (i)\u00a0make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection\nwith any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any\nShares acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii)\u00a0do not commit to and are under no\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant\u2019s liability for Tax-Related Items or\nachieve any particular tax result.

In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number\nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested\nRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back\n4",
  "solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the\nproceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant\u2019s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electronic Delivery and Acceptance.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is\nreferred to as the \u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \u201cAward Date.\u201d The\nAward was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the\n\u201cPlan\u201d). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the\nAward.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\nfor the determination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are\nan unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and\nExhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \u201cVesting Date\u201d).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the\nParticipant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an\napproved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence,\nin each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of\na personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant\u2019s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant\u2019s other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant\u2019s consent thereto.\n1",

The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no\ndividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the\nRSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the\nParticipant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i)\u00a0the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii)\u00a0the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award\nthat are outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a \u201cDividend Equivalent Right\u201d). Any Dividend Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to\nthe foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms, conditions and restrictions as the\noriginal RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however, that the amount of any vested\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend Equivalent Rights that are paid will\ncorrespond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of\nDividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, as of the record date for that dividend,\nhave either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit A.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Restrictions on Transfer.

On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to\nSection 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 \u00bd) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the\nParticipant a number of Shares equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items. The\nCompany\u2019s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person\nentitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents\nor assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are\nsettled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effect of Termination of Service.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\nthe event the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service is due to the Participant\u2019s death or Disability and the Severance Date occurs prior to the\nVesting Date, on the Vesting Date the Award shall vest with respect to a number of RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights)\ndetermined by multiplying (i)\u00a0the RSUs subject to the Award that would have otherwise vested pursuant to the Award on such Vesting Date but\nfor the Termination of Service and to the extent the applicable performance-based vesting requirement is satisfied, by (ii)\u00a0the Severance Fraction\n2",
  "(determined as set forth below). Any RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that are unvested on the Severance Date and that\nare not eligible to vest on the Vesting Date following the Severance Date pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Severance\nDate, and any RSUs that remain outstanding and unvested after giving effect to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the Vesting Date.\nThe \u201cSeverance Fraction\u201d means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be determined by subtracting the number of days remaining in the\nPerformance Period on the Severance Date from the total number of days in the Performance Period, and the denominator of which shall be the\ntotal number of days in the Performance Period. If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as\nthe related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that\nany RSUs remain outstanding following the Severance Date by reason of this Section 8, but the applicable performance-based vesting\nconditions are not satisfied, such RSUs shall automatically terminate and be canceled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without\npayment of any consideration by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant\u2019s beneficiary or personal\nrepresentative, as the case may be.\n9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recoupment.

In addition, the Company may require\nthe Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be issued,\ndelivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of any such\nShares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:\n(a)\nduring the period of the Participant\u2019s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the\n\u201cEmployment Period\u201d), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or\noffense under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);\n(b)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of\nconfidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of the\nCompany or any of its Subsidiaries;\n(c)\nduring the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,\nembezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\nFor purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant\u2019s\nbehalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator holding the Participant\u2019s Shares and/or other amounts acquired under the Plan to\nre-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. By accepting this Award, the Participant further\nagrees to comply with any request or demand for repayment by the Company in order to comply with such policies or Applicable Laws. To the\nextent that the terms of this Agreement and any Company recoupment policy conflict, the terms of the recoupment policy shall prevail. This\nSection 9 is not the Company\u2019s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.\n10.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company\u2019s stock contemplated by\nSection 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in\naccordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be\n3",
  "issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent\nRights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).\n11.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant\u2019s\nemployer (\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that\nthe Company and/or the Employer (i)\u00a0make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection\nwith any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any\nShares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii)\u00a0do not commit to and are under no\nobligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant\u2019s liability for Tax-Related Items or\nachieve any particular tax result.

In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or\n4",
  "to the Company or Employer.

The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the\n\u201cParticipant.\u201d The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the \u201cAward Date.\u201d The Award was granted\nunder and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the \u201cPlan\u201d). Capitalized terms\nare defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to\nas the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the Award.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the\ndetermination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are an\nunfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each\nvesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a \u201cVesting Date.\u201d) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional\nShares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined\nfractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next\nsubsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and\nthe rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Award Date and the first\nVesting Date, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award\nAgreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the\nfirst thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of\nthe Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal leave of absence.\nNothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the\nParticipant\u2019s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain\nemployed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to\nterminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant\u2019s other\ncompensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant\nwithout the Participant\u2019s consent thereto.\n1",

No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the\nShares as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.\n(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Dividend Equivalent Rights. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its Shares, the\nCompany shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i)\u00a0the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its Shares on such\ndate, multiplied by (ii)\u00a0the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to the Award that\nare outstanding on the record date for that dividend (a \u201cDividend Equivalent Right\u201d).

The Company\u2019s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise settle vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent\nthat the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any\nrepresentations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights\nwith respect to any RSUs that are settled or that are forfeited pursuant to Section 8.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Effect of Termination of Service.\n(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant\u2019s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend\nEquivalent Rights) shall terminate and be forfeited to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the date of the Participant\u2019s\nTermination of Service (the \u201cSeverance Date\u201d), regardless of the reason for the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service, whether with or without\ncause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a\nVesting Date.\n(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant\u2019s\nTermination of Service due to the Participant\u2019s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, any unvested\nRSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall continue to be eligible to vest on a pro rata basis (in accordance\n2",

For purposes of this Award Agreement, \u201cRetirement\u201d\nmeans the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10)\nyears of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by the Company) as of the Severance Date, as\ndetermined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant\u2019s Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of\nthe Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall otherwise determine in its sole discretion.

The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant\u2019s\nemployer (\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.

In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number\nof Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested\nRSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may\nrefuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the\nParticipant\u2019s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.\n12.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Electronic Delivery and Acceptance.

Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these\nTerms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the \u201cAward Agreement\u201d applicable to the\nAward.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RSUs. As used herein, the term \u201cRSU\u201d shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to\nbe equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device\nfor the determination of the Shares eventually to be issued to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs are\nan unfunded and unsecured right to receive Shares and shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vesting.

Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued\nactive employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award\nAgreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the performance or vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the\nParticipant to any proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an\napproved leave of absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence,\nin each case as approved by the Company, in its sole discretion.

The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant\u2019s\nemployer (\u201cEmployer\u201d) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant\u2019s\nresponsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer.

In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items\ndirectly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer.

  "Exhibit 19.1\nInsider Trading Policy\nA-2",
  "This policy is designed to prevent trading of securities when a person is aware of material nonpublic information.\nTrading while aware of material nonpublic information is a crime. Penalties for insider trading can include significant fines, monetary damages\nand prison time. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and the Department of Justice prioritize these\ntypes of cases. They dedicate significant resources and use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to identify illegal trading\nactivities. The reason for the transaction, size of the transaction, or the amount of profit received does not have to be significant \u2014 even\nsmall insider trading violations may be monitored, aggressively investigated, and prosecuted. Agencies outside of the United States take a\nsimilar approach under local insider trading laws.\nWho is Covered by this Policy?\nThis policy applies to all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, and consultants. It also applies to\nfamily members who reside with you or are financially dependent on you, and any other person or entity whose transactions in securities are\ndirected by you or are subject to your influence or control. This includes entities such as family trusts, partnerships and foundations. You must\nensure that people and entities whose trading activities you directly or indirectly influence or control, or those whose trading activity would\nreasonably be perceived by others to be under your influence or control, comply with the terms of this policy.\nInsider Trading Prohibitions\nNo Trading While Aware of Material Nonpublic Information. Never buy or sell Apple securities when aware of information that has not\nbeen publicly announced and that could have a material effect on the value of the securities. Information should be considered nonpublic for\nat least 24 hours after it has been distributed to the general public.\nNo Tipping. Do not disclose (\u201ctip\u201d) material nonpublic information to other persons, including family members, or make any\nrecommendation about whether to buy or sell Apple securities while aware of material nonpublic information.\nNo Third-Party Trading or Tipping. Do not trade in the securities of another company when aware of material nonpublic information about\nthat company in connection with your work at Apple. This includes trading in the stock of Apple suppliers, manufacturers, vendors or\ncustomers, such as cellular network carriers or other business partners. You must also not tip material nonpublic information about another\ncompany.\nNo Trading During Restricted Trading Periods. If you are subject to a restricted trading period, you must not buy or sell Apple securities\nwhile trading restrictions are in effect.\nNo Short Sales, Hedging or Trading in Derivatives. Short sales, transactions that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any\ndecrease in the value of Apple securities, and transactions in derivatives of Apple securities, are prohibited at all times. This includes\ntransactions involving prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, options, warrants, puts, calls, or similar instruments related to\nApple securities. Additionally, members of Apple\u2019s Board of Directors and executive officers are prohibited from pledging Apple stock as\ncollateral.\nUpdated September 2024\n2",
  "In addition to the above prohibitions, this policy includes important additional information.\n\u201cMaterial\u201d Nonpublic Information\nDetermining whether information is \u201cmaterial\u201d requires consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. In general, information is\nmaterial if it would likely be considered important by an investor who is deciding whether to buy or sell a security, or if the information is likely\nto have a significant effect on the market price of the security. Both positive and negative information may be material. \u201cMateriality\u201d is different\nfor different companies. Information that is not material to Apple may be material to another company.\n\u201cNonpublic\u201d Information\n\u201cNonpublic\u201d information means information that has not been previously disclosed to the general public and is otherwise not available to the\ngeneral public. Information should be considered nonpublic for at least 24 hours after it has been distributed to the general public through a\npress release, filing with the SEC, or similar means. The circulation of rumors, even if accurate and reported in the media, is not considered\neffective public distribution.\nPolicy Violations\nApple personnel who violate this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and repayment of\nequity awards. Additionally, individuals who engage in illegal insider trading or tipping can be liable for substantial criminal and civil\npenalties.\nIf you have any doubt whether information is public or material, or have questions about this policy, consult Apple\u2019s team by emailing\n[***] or calling [***].\nUpdated September 2024\n3",

  "Exhibit 97.1\nRule 10D-1 Recovery Policy\nA. Introduction\nThis Rule 10D-1 Recovery Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) is administered by the People and Compensation Committee of the\nBoard of Directors of Apple Inc. (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), and covers Incentive-Based Compensation granted, awarded or paid\nby Apple Inc. or any of its subsidiaries (\u201cApple\u201d) to any employee who is an \u201cexecutive officer\u201d of Apple (each a \u201cCovered\nExecutive\u201d) as defined under Section 10D-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act\u00a0 of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d). The Policy is\nintended to comply with, and as applicable to be administered and interpreted consistent with, and subject to the\nexceptions set forth in, Listing Rule 5608 adopted by the Nasdaq Stock Market to implement Rule 10D-1 under the\nExchange Act (collectively referred to herein as \u201cRule 10D-1\u201d). For avoidance of doubt the Policy only applies to Covered\nExecutives who served as a Covered Executive for Apple at any point during the performance period for any Incentive-\nBased Compensation that is Received on or after October 2, 2023. The Policy explains when Apple will be required to\nseek recovery of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation from a Covered Executive.\nB. Incentive-Based Compensation\nFor purposes of this Policy, \u201cIncentive-Based Compensation\u201d means any compensation granted, earned or vested based\nin whole or in part upon the attainment of one or more financial reporting measures, that was Received (i) on or after\nOctober 2, 2023 and (ii) by a person who served as a Covered Executive at any time during the performance period for\nthe Incentive-Based Compensation. Financial reporting measures are (i) any measure(s) that are determined and\npresented in accordance with the accounting principles used in Apple\u2019s financial statements and any measure(s) derived\nin whole or in part from such measure(s) and (ii) any measure(s) that are based in whole or in part on Apple\u2019s stock price\nor total shareholder return. For avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation includes awards granted to a\nCovered Executive that are outstanding and unvested as of October 2, 2023. Incentive-Based Compensation is\n\u201cReceived\u201d in the fiscal period that the relevant financial reporting measure is attained regardless of when it is paid or\nawarded.\nFor avoidance of doubt, incentive-based compensation that is not earned or vested based on the attainment of one or\nmore financial measures, including but not limited to time-based restricted stock units, is not covered compensation\nunder this Policy but may be recouped under the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment Policy.",
  "C. Administration\nThe Committee is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may\nbe necessary or appropriate for the administration of this Policy and engage third parties as it deems necessary to\nevaluate erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation Received. If the Committee determines Incentive-Based\nCompensation was erroneously awarded and recovery is required pursuant to this Policy, Apple shall make any required\ndisclosures for any affected Covered Executives in its annual proxy statement. Apple will maintain and will provide to the\nNasdaq Stock Market documentation of all determinations and actions taken in complying with the Policy. Any\ndeterminations made by the Committee under this Policy shall be final and binding on all affected individuals.\nD. Section 10D-1 Recovery\nPursuant to Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make reasonable efforts to recover any Incentive-Based Compensation\nReceived by any Covered Executive during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date that Apple\nis required to prepare an Accounting Restatement under Rule 10D-1 and any transition period of less than nine months\nthat is within or immediately following such three years if the Committee determines the Incentive-Based Compensation\nwas erroneously awarded. An \u201cAccounting Restatement\u201d is a correction to Apple\u2019s financial statements that, due to\nApple\u2019s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. federal securities laws, is (1) is\nmaterial to a prior financial reporting period or (2) would be material to the current financial reporting period if corrected\nin the current period or left uncorrected in the current period.\nRecovery will be limited to the amount of the gross, pre-tax, Incentive-Based Compensation that was erroneously\nReceived because it exceeded the amount that would have been Received had it been determined based on any\nrestated financial measures in the Accounting Restatement. If the Incentive-Based Compensation is based on stock\nprice or total shareholder return, the Committee shall determine a reasonable estimate of the effect of the Accounting\nRestatement, if any, on the stock price or total shareholder return and based on that reasonable estimate, whether\nIncentive-Based Compensation was erroneously awarded.\nIf the erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation cannot be recovered because recovery efforts are\nexcessively burdensome, the recovery value exceeds the cost of recovery to Apple or recovery would be contrary to\nlaws outside the United States, each as determined in accordance with Rule 10D-1, the Committee will make a\ndetermination whether further recovery efforts would be in shareholders\u2019 best interests and should continue or would\notherwise be excusable under Rule 10D-1.\n2",
  "If the Committee determines a Covered Executive Received erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation, the\nCommittee shall determine the timing and method of recovery in its sole direction and direct Apple to recover any\nerroneously awarded amounts as soon as administratively practicable. The methods of recovery include but are not\nlimited to, requiring reimbursement from the Covered Executive, electing to withhold or suspend unpaid Incentive-Based\nCompensation, by offset (subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the \u201cCode\u201d) if applicable), forcing the sale of shares issued pursuant to Incentive-Based Compensation,\nrescinding, cancelling, or otherwise causing the forfeiture of any unvested or unpaid Incentive-Based Compensation,\ndeducting from amounts otherwise payable to the Covered Executive including base salary, commissions, time-based\nequity awards or other compensation, or by requiring incremental payments from the Covered Executive using one or\nmore of the above methods or any other methods authorized by applicable law.\nApple shall not indemnify any Covered Executive for the loss of any Incentive-Based Compensation or the cost of any\nthird-party insurance to cover the same.\nE. Rights and Remedies; Waiver; Amendment; Extension\nThis Policy shall supplement and not limit any other rights or remedies Apple may have under applicable law, any other\nApple policy, including the Apple Inc. Executive Team Compensation Recoupment Policy, any applicable plan,\nagreement, other arrangement, or otherwise, including, but not limited to, termination of employment, initiation of other\ndisciplinary procedures, and/or the institution of civil or criminal proceedings, provided however, if Incentive-Based\nCompensation is recovered under this Policy it would not be subject to double recovery under any other Apple policy,\nplan, agreement or arrangement unless specifically required under applicable law.\nThis Policy may from time to time be waived, amended, or extended to other employees of Apple, as determined by the\nCommittee, or as otherwise required under Rule 10D-1.\n***\n3"
