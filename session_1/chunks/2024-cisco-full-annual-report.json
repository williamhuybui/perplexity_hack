  "2\nCisco Annual Report 2024\nFiscal 2024 was a momentous year for Cisco. We delivered \nsolid results, closed the largest acquisition in our history, \nintroduced industry-defining innovation, and served our \ncustomers and partners in new and exciting ways. After \na challenging start, we ended the year seeing steady \ncustomer demand and are entering fiscal 2025 with \nmomentum and optimism.\nI am incredibly proud of the Cisco teams for achieving these \nresults in a dynamic operating environment. While some \nheadwinds remain, I am extremely confident in our ability to \nhelp our customers drive their most critical outcomes, seize \nthe massive growth opportunities that exist in the market \n\u2014 particularly in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity \u2014 \nand deliver exceptional value for our stockholders.\nSolid results\nWe delivered nearly $54 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024,  \nthe second strongest performance in our history, and 51% \nof our total revenues came from subscriptions. These results \nare a testament to the work we\u2019ve done to transform our \nbusiness mix, create more visibility and predictability in our \nmodel, and provide ongoing value to our customers.\nOur focus on operational discipline and execution helped us \ndeliver strong profitability and return more than $12 billion \n\u2014 119% of our free cash flow \u2014 to our stockholders through \nstock repurchases and dividends in fiscal 2024.\nCisco and Splunk: better together\nOur acquisition of Splunk \u2014 our largest ever \u2014 was \ncompleted on March 18, 2024, significantly earlier than \ninitially anticipated. With Splunk now part of Cisco, we \nLetter to stockholders\nTo our stockholders,\nbelieve we have an unmatched capability to unlock the full \npower of the network and help deliver even greater value \nto customers.\nGary Steele, former CEO of Splunk and now the President of \nCisco leading Go-to-Market, is overseeing the integration to \nensure a seamless transition for our teams, our customers, \nand our partners. We\u2019ve made significant progress since we \nbrought the Splunk and Cisco teams together, integrating \npowerful new customer solutions and beginning to realize \nearly synergies. We also signed our first cross-portfolio \nagreement that includes Splunk in fiscal 2024, and we \nexpect this momentum to carry into fiscal 2025 and beyond.\nSolving our customers\u2019 largest challenges\nThe world around us is constantly changing, and organizations \nare adapting to meet the demands of an increasingly complex \ntechnology landscape. Our customers need to modernize \ntheir infrastructures, improve their cybersecurity postures, and \nharness the full power of AI and data, all while building agility \nand resiliency across their entire digital footprint.\nOur pace of innovation is increasing, and our portfolio has \nnever been more relevant or more tightly aligned to our \ncustomers key priorities and objectives. Over the past year, \nwe introduced significant innovation and reinforced our \ncommitment to offering a more streamlined and cohesive \nexperience for our customers.\nThis includes introducing two innovations which we believe \nare among the most substantial in our history. The first \nis Cisco Hypershield, the first truly distributed, AI-native \ncybersecurity solution, built into the fabric of the network. We \nbelieve that Hypershield combines security and networking \nin a way only Cisco can, providing better connectivity and \nprotecting against modern threats at the same time.\nThe second innovation is Cisco Nexus HyperFabric, a \nbreakthrough AI cluster solution\u00a0that combines Cisco AI-\nnative networking with NVIDIA accelerated computing and \nAI software, and robust VAST data storage. This full-stack, \ncloud-managed platform helps our enterprise customers \nbuild infrastructure to run generative AI models and \ninference applications.\nWe believe the true power of Cisco comes from integrating \nour portfolio together in unique ways to offer our customers \nrobust, end-to-end platforms that deliver better outcomes, \nsimplify the user experience, and maximize business value.",
  "3\nCisco Annual Report 2024\n\u201cWith Cisco\u2019s leadership and  \nbroad portfolio across Networking, \nSecurity, Collaboration, and \nObservability, and now with \nthe addition of Splunk, we are \nin a unique position to help our \ncustomers connect and protect \nevery aspect of their organizations \nin the era of AI.\u201d\nWe recently announced that we are bringing our \nNetworking, Security, and Collaboration teams together \nas one product organization under a single innovative and \nproven leader, Jeetu Patel, our new Chief Product Officer. \nThe Splunk product portfolio will also be integrated into this \norganization in time, so that we can bring the full power of \nCisco to every customer. \nInvesting to win in AI\nWhile AI offers unlimited potential, it also creates or \nexacerbates different challenges. We believe we are \nuniquely positioned to help address those challenges and \narm our customers with the infrastructure, security, data, \nand observability platforms they need to build, launch, \nmonitor, and monetize AI applications at scale.\nWe have crossed $1 billion in AI orders with Webscale \ncustomers to date, and we expect an additional $1 billion of \nAI product orders from these customers in fiscal 2025. We \nalso believe we are well positioned to be the key beneficiary \nof AI application proliferation in the Enterprise.\nWe are pioneering technological solutions through our \nongoing investment in silicon, hardware, and optics. This \nincludes Cisco Silicon One, our high-performance, low-\npower, and scalable networking silicon architecture that \nprovides the features and efficiency needed to power \nAI workloads. We plan to integrate Silicon One into all \nof our products and systems over time as part of our \nstructural advantage.\nWe are also enhancing our own productivity by using AI in \nour Services and Customer Experience organization. We \nhave a robust AI and Automation framework that touches  \nat least 50% of our service requests.\nIn fiscal 2024, we launched a $1 billion global AI investment \nfund to bolster the startup ecosystem and expand the \ndevelopment of secure and reliable AI solutions. Through \nthis fund, as well as our internal incubation and R&D efforts, \nwe believe we can help realize the next generation of \ntechnology to meet our customers\u2019 future needs.\nLiving our purpose\nEvery day, Cisco is focused on driving customer outcomes \nas well as working to Power an Inclusive Future for All. For \nexample, as we work towards our 2040 net zero goal, our \ntechnologies such as Silicon One are helping customers \nreduce their own power consumption and greenhouse gas \nemissions at the same time.\nAs we continue to navigate uncertain times, we always look for \nareas where we can have a positive impact and drive the most \nvalue. I am very proud that we achieved our goal of positively \nimpacting one billion people by 2025 ahead of schedule.\nI\u2019m also very proud of the work the Cisco Crisis Response \nteam does in partnership with local communities and \nagencies to prepare for, respond to, and sustainably \nrebuild from global crises. This team\u2019s ability to provide \nconnectivity in extremely challenging conditions, restoring \ncommunications when and where they are needed most, \nexemplifies the amazing culture we have at Cisco.\nIn closing, I want to express my gratitude to our stockholders \nfor your trust in Cisco. While we have faced challenges, we  \nhave also embraced new opportunities, strengthened our \nfoundation, and positioned the company for continued \ngrowth and success.\nAs we look to the future, I am confident in our ability to \ncreate even greater value for our stockholders, customers, \npartners, and employees. Together, we will continue to \nbuild on our achievements and drive forward with purpose \nand determination. Thank you for your support on this \nexciting journey.\nChuck Robbins \nChair and Chief Executive Officer \nOctober 18, 2024",

But \neven as the world electrifies, we must simultaneously reduce the amount of \nenergy used by a connected economy. \nTo help advance these priorities, we will:\n\t\n\u25cf\nImprove our product power efficiency\n\t\n\u25cf\nCollaborate with our customers, partners, and suppliers to accelerate \nthe energy transition\n\t\n\u25cf\nContinue to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy use in \nCisco\u2019s operations\nOne important piece of Cisco\u2019s clean energy strategy is our goal to reach \nnet-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2040, \nby prioritizing reductions across all scopes of emissions. We are proud \nthat Cisco\u2019s 2040 net-zero goal was approved by the Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi) in 2022, under its Net-Zero Standard. Cisco was \none of the first technology hardware and equipment companies to have its \nnet-zero goal validated under the SBTi Net-Zero Standard. Additionally, a \n15-year Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA) in Europe that became \noperational in March 2024 will continue to further our efforts related to our \nclean energy strategy.\nEvolving the business to circular\nCisco is focused on evolving from a linear economy that extracts \nresources and eventually wastes them, to a circular one that finds new \nuses for products and their inputs. We aim to transform our business \nto extend the useful life of our products and provide ongoing services. \nWe take a holistic approach to reduce the environmental impact of our \nproducts by focusing on:\n\t\n\u25cf\nApplying circular design principles to our products and packaging and \nextending the lifecycle of our products\n\t\n\u25cf\nEnabling customers and partners to adopt circularity through our \nportfolio of circular offerings\n\t\n\u25cf\nRecovering and redeploying end-of use hardware to advance a circular \nlifecycle through reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling",

We are also embedding AI assistants and automated functions into our \nservices to drive productivity.\nCustomers and Markets \nMany factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the \norganization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the \ncustomer\u2019s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. Our customers \nprimarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, public sector and service provider and cloud.\nEnterprise\nEnterprise includes businesses that are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices, \nor mid-market and small businesses. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a \nmulti-vendor environment. Our mid-market and small business customers typically require the latest advanced technologies, but \nwith less complexity. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our \nservice provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and \nchannel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers.\nPublic Sector\nPublic Sector includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers.

  "utilities, and consumers worldwide. Service provider and cloud businesses use a variety of our products and services for their \nown networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer \nmanaged or internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more \nlikely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their \nnetworks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n4",
  "Sales Overview \nAs of the end of fiscal 2024, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 28,000 employees, \nincluding managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and \nindirectly through a variety of channels with support from our sales workforce. A substantial portion of our products and \nservices is sold indirectly through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include \nsystems integrators, service providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors.\nSystems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical \nsupport, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also \ntypically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other third-party resellers. We refer to \nsales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized \nbased on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of \ninventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing \nprograms.\nOur service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software \nmaintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers.\nFor information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factors entitled \n\u201cDisruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins\u201d and \u201cInventory management relating to \nour sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\u201d\nFor information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factors \nentitled \u201cOur operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain \ngeopolitical environment;\u201d \u201cEntrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely \nincrease demands on our service and support operations;\u201d \u201cDue to the global nature of our operations, political or economic \nchanges or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;\u201d \u201cWe are \nexposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;\u201d and \n\u201cCyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may disrupt our operations, harm \nour operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber \nattacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers\u2019 or third-party providers\u2019 networks, or in third-party products we use, \ncould result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise \nmaterially harm our business,\u201d among others.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe \ncustomer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant \ninfrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include loans, leases (sales-type, direct financing and operating) and \nchannel financing arrangements.\nAcquisitions, Investments, and Alliances\nThe markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. We continue to evaluate \nopportunities to acquire and invest in businesses and technologies that complement and enable further investment in our key \npriority areas.\nAcquisitions\nWe acquire companies in order to gain access to talent, technology, products and features, operational capabilities or new \nmarkets. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factor \nentitled \u201cWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating \nresults.\u201d\nInvestments in Privately Held Companies\nWe make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our \nproducts or that provide insights into emerging technologies that may become relevant to our businesses. The risks associated \nwith these investments are more fully discussed in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are exposed",

  "Strategic Alliances\nWe pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and \naccelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology \nexchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation.\nThe risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d including the risk factor \nentitled \u201cIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances \nand we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.\u201d\nCompetition\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, \nand help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. We compete with \nnumerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may \nincrease. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and \nin key priority areas. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In \nparticular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate \nthis will continue.\nOur competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista \nNetworks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Ciena Corporation; CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.; Datadog Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; \nDynatrace Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; \nMicrosoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nvidia Corporation; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; \nZoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product \narea. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are \nregularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering \nresources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but \nalso from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those \nmarkets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have \nstrategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise \ndata center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, \nnetworking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Additionally, companies that are strategic alliance partners \nin some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the \nability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products \nand services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer \nvalue and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added \nfeatures such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to \nprovide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models. \nWe also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer \ntechnology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, \ncompete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, \nand strategic alliance partners could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly \naffect our chances of success. \nResearch and Development\nWe regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and \ndevelopment budget among our product categories, which consist of Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability \ntechnologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus",

We allocate our research and \ndevelopment budget among our product categories, which consist of Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability \ntechnologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus \nbeing identified from time to time. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred.\nThe industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer \nrequirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability, on a \ncost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that \nimprove performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering \npersonnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of internet \nnetworking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and \n6",
  "strategic investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance \nthat we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that \nthose products will achieve market acceptance.\nManufacturing\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party \ncompanies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. \nProprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer \nrequirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and \nsoftware in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process also \nuses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process \ncontrols, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and \nprocedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards.\nOur arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as \nmanufacturing process terms, such as inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; \noversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-\nterm contracts with any contract manufacturers. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. \nThese arrangements with contract manufacturers generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any \nquantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time.\nPatents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\nWe seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, \ntrademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in \nthe United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to \nmaintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate \nconfidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other \ncountries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products \nin every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has \nvalue, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success \ndependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on \nthe protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be \nnecessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past \nexperience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. \nNonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability \nto obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in \nlitigation regarding these matters, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, \ninclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit \nour ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent \nclaims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents \nand other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property \nrights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage.

Our goal is to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help our \ncustomers connect and secure their infrastructure, and accelerate their digital agility. Our relationship with our employees is one \nof mutual benefit. Our employees bring talent and ingenuity to everything we do, and in turn, we provide employees with \nmeaningful careers and development opportunities.\nCisco is currently ranked #2 on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For\u00ae 2024 in the United States. Fortune and Great \nPlace to Work have published their United States rankings since 1998, and Cisco has been recognized on every annual list. \nCisco is currently #1 in the following 18 countries: Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, \nKorea, Mexico, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\nAs of July 27, 2024, we had approximately 90,400 employees and they are categorized as follows:\nWe support our employees through times of change and enable them to be their best. We do this by fostering a Conscious \nCulture. Conscious Culture speaks to the importance of everyone being aware \u2014 \u201cconscious\u201d \u2014 of the environment they are \npart of, and feeling accountable, empowered, and expected to contribute to creating a culture where all Cisco employees feel \nsafe and can thrive. Conscious Culture encourages employees to be aware of how we treat one another and to speak up when \nwe see behavior that\u2019s out of step with our beliefs. We believe there is a direct connection between the culture we create \ninternally and how our people are helping to bring about a better world. \nIn the same way that every employee at Cisco is responsible for our Conscious Culture, we also want every employee to feel \nresponsible for and contribute to our purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All. We believe this is as much a commitment \nfrom Cisco as it is from our employees. Our people often ask the toughest questions around how we are impacting society for \nthe better, from addressing homelessness to combating climate change. And often the best ideas for how we can do even more \ncome directly from them. Future employees expect it too. We recognize that talent increasingly wants to work for a company \nwhere their work has meaning and where they see their values reflected in the organization.\nInclusion & Diversity\nInclusion and diversity are core components in our Conscious Culture. Inclusivity is our strength and our priority. We want \nevery employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We are prioritizing inclusion and diversity across the company, \nrecognizing that connecting people of all experiences and backgrounds allows us to improve innovation and collaboration.\nIn order to continue accelerating diversity and finding extraordinary talent, we have designed a framework that includes \nintroducing new tools and technologies to help accurately map the talent market, creating job roles that attract highly qualified \ndiverse candidates, and expanding the diversity within our interview panels. \nWe currently have a total of 31 Inclusive Communities supporting full-spectrum diversity globally, including gender, ethnicity, \nrace, sexual orientation, age, ability, veteran status, religion, culture, background, as well as varied experiences, strengths, and \nperspectives. These thriving communities continue to be a source of strength and support for employees, and they help to foster \na more Conscious Culture by providing opportunities for proximity and learning.\n8\nEmployee by Line Items on Consolidated Statement of \nOperations\nCost of\nsales\n30.8%\nSales and\nmarketing\n30.7%\nResearch and\ndevelopment\n27.4%\nGeneral and\nadministrative\n11.1%\nEmployees by Geography\nUnited States\n48.1%\nRest of World\n51.9%",

The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge is a \nCEO-driven pledge to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the \nworkplace. We are delivering on these actions by accelerating diversity across the full-spectrum of diversity \u2014 including \ngender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, experience, \nstrengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it starts at the top: As of July 27, 2024, 36% of our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) are \nwomen and 43% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity. \nWe publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven \nbroad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our fiscal 2023 data, our global employee base was comprised of \n29% women, 71% men and 0.1% nonbinary, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 48.2% \nWhite/Caucasian, 33.5% Asian, 6.5% Hispanic/Latino, 5.6% African American/Black, 2.0% two or more races (not Hispanic or \nLatino), 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 3.7% prefer to not to \ndisclose/unknown.\nWith respect to social justice, Cisco has been partnering across the globe to scale and amplify our positive impact. We have \npublished our Social Justice Beliefs & Actions, which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for \nany community. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of \ndiversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, and background \u2014 which is the \nfoundation of our Conscious Culture. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for \nvulnerable communities. Our Social Justice Action Office helps drive accountability, progress, and excellence in our strategic \nactions in this area, which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers, and \nsuppliers.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward, and retain talent. It provides market competitive, \nperformance-based compensation aligned with each employee\u2019s contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, \npartners and stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and \ngrowth within our geographies, product lines, and functions. \nCisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signatory of the \nWhite House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and are a leader in the charge to make fair pay a reality for all \nemployees through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework \nthat provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful \nanalytics, we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them.\nAs part of our Social Justice Beliefs and Actions, we have expanded our pay parity program beyond base salary to include \nadditional forms of compensation fairness such as promotion, bonuses, and stock decisions made in our rewards programs. We \naim to ensure the program addresses all employees across the full spectrum of diversity incorporating our global self-reported \ndata collection. \nHealth & Well-being\nWe have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We seek to provide our \nemployees and their families with high-quality, flexible, and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and \nfinancial well-being. We strive to support our employees as they balance careers and personal lives, as well as their own \nphysical, emotional, and financial health. We continue to emphasize a focus on both physical and mental health, recognizing the \nneed to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health and other matters. \nWe host ongoing discussions with our employees during the Cisco Beat and Cisco Check-Ins, our regular company-wide virtual \nmeetings, and continue to emphasize our Safe to Talk program. We offer mindfulness courses, employee assistance program \nofferings, and out-of-network provider benefits for substance abuse and mental health treatment, and more. In fiscal 2024, we \ncontinued to offer employees \u201cA Day for Me,\u201d which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest. \nWe employ a hybrid work model in certain countries, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite Cisco \nlocations. \nEmployee Development",

  "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and \nuncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking \nstatements contained in this report.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur operations can be difficult to predict because our operating results may fluctuate in future periods. \nOur operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of \nnumerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic \nenvironment. These factors include:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to service providers and internet \nbusinesses, in part due to changes in the global economic environment\n\u2022\nChanges in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers\u2019 spending \nplans and associated revenue\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments\n\u2022\nPrice and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to \ntechnological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions\n\u2022\nThe overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers\n\u2022\nThe introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products, and our success in new and evolving \nmarkets, and in emerging technologies, as well as the adoption of new standards\n\u2022\nVariations in sales channels, product costs, mix of products sold, or mix of direct sales and indirect sales\n\u2022\nThe timing, size, and mix of orders from customers\n\u2022\nManufacturing and customer lead times\n\u2022\nFluctuations in our gross margins, and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations\n\u2022\nThe ability of our customers, channel partners, contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund \ncapital expenditures, especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer, \nchannel partner, contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems\n\u2022\nActual events, circumstances, outcomes, and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in \ndetermining the values of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities, and other \nitems reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements\n\u2022\nHow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that \ncould result in significant restructuring charges\n\u2022\nOur ability to achieve targeted cost reductions\n\u2022\nBenefits anticipated from our investments\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws or accounting rules, or interpretations thereof\nAs a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not \nnecessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed \nelsewhere herein, could materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nOur operating results may be negatively impacted by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain \ngeopolitical environment. \nChallenging economic conditions, including rising inflation, or other changes, worldwide have from time to time contributed, \nand may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific \nsegments and markets in which we operate, resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints \non IT-related capital spending by our customers, particularly service provider and cloud as well as enterprise and other \ncustomer markets; increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of \ncustomers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories; risk of supply constraints; risk of excess \nfacilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\nThe global macroeconomic environment can be challenging and inconsistent. In certain prior periods, we have seen a broad-\nbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our \nmarkets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary \n12",
  "policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world (including as a result of the on-going Russia \nand Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war, and China-Taiwan relations), the current economic challenges in China, including \nglobal economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties, and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global \neconomic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, were to deteriorate, we \nmay experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition. \nOur operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly \ngermane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence \ngathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers\u2019 perception of the products of IT companies which design \nand manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and \ngrowth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence \ngathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United \nStates and could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results. \nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, which can be \nexacerbated during periods when the global macroenvironment is challenging and inconsistent and can result in market \nuncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods, or decline as it did in fiscal 2024 and certain prior \nperiods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be negatively impacted if the nonlinear \nsales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we \nexperienced a decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend as they \nneeded additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. We have also experienced \nperiods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading \nto nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in \nshipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which \novertime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the \nextent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly \nin periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter \ncould be negatively impacted if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter. \nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant impact on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. \nFrom time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order \nis recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such \norders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to \nquarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Longer than normal manufacturing lead \ntimes in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times \nwithin our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also place \norders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of \norder cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time \nperformance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing \ncomponent supply-related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components in \norder to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. These \nincreases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and",
  "component supply-related challenges, we have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components in \norder to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. These \nincreases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to potential material excess and \nobsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross margin in future periods if product demand \nsignificantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for \ndevelopment, or we are unable to continue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for \nfuture periods can be difficult to predict or may persist longer than anticipated. We plan our operating expense levels based \nprimarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the \nshort term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to \nquickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could materially harm \nour operations and financial results. For additional information and a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our \ninventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see \u201cResults of Operations\n\u2014Product Gross Margin\u2014Supply Chain Impacts and Risks\u201d, \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Inventory Supply Chain\u201d \nunder Item 7 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.\n13",
  "Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of \nadequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill \norders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand \nproperly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could negatively impact our gross margins.\nThe fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply \nchain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results. Financial problems \nof either contract manufacturers or component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers \nby other companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the \nsemiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs.\nA reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain, caused in part by public health \nemergencies, geopolitical tensions (including as a result of China-Taiwan relations) or a significant natural disaster (including \nas a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more components (including as a result of inflation); a \nfailure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, \nreschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially \nharm our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, \nas a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that \nare higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices \nin excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. In addition, \nvendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or \ndemand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken \nother mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could \nmaterially harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our \nsuppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by \nmanufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations, including longer than normal lead times. For example, in recent \nperiods, there was a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which affected lead times, the cost of that \nsupply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of \ncertain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract \nmanufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems \nresulting from industry consolidation, or strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater \npressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific \nproduct categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive \ncomponents, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing \ncapacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the \ncomponents may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We \nmay not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely \nmanner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources \ncan be developed. \nAlthough in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available \nonly from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively \nimpact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times when there are supplier",
  "can be developed. \nAlthough in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available \nonly from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively \nimpact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times when there are supplier \nconstraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a \ntimely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow \nquickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity; as we acquire companies and new \ntechnologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for \ncertain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.\nManufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase \ncomponents from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our \nproducts. During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure \nadequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to \nprocure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain \ninstances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs \nprior to firm orders being placed. When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring \ncomponents in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase \n14",
  "commitments. In past periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply constraints seen \nindustry-wide due to component shortages. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times \ncould also lead to potential material excess and obsolete inventory charges or other negative impacts to our product gross \nmargin in future periods if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly and product demand significantly decreases for a \nsustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to \ncontinue to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures. Product demand conditions for future periods can be difficult to \npredict or may persist longer than anticipated.

Service \nprovider and cloud product orders significantly decreased during fiscal 2024 and we have experienced similar declines in \ncertain prior periods. Product orders from the service provider and cloud market could continue to decline and, as has been the \ncase in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions.

Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital \nexpenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, \npolitical or regulatory uncertainty), could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such \nslowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the \ncompetitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service \nprovider and cloud customers have been negatively impacted by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by \nchanges in the service provider and cloud market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, \nresulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have negatively \nimpacted our business and operating results in the past, and could materially harm our business and operating results in any \nfuture period. Finally, service provider and cloud customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader \nrange of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance \nprovisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add \nfurther risk to business conducted with service providers.\nDisruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\nIf we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors\u2019 financial condition or operations \nweaken, our revenue and gross margins could be negatively impacted. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold \nthrough our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, \nservice providers, other third-party resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to \nend users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition \nto network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of \nservice providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service \nproviders, and other third-party resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end \ncustomer. If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products \nand, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers. \nHistorically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. There \ncan be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on \nour gross margins and profitability. Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which could \nharm our sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including through our \ndirect sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or \notherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their \ncustomers may ask them to bear; some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to \nwithstand changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors\u2019 \nfinancial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable \nregulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to do so, that could materially harm our business, operating results, and \nfinancial condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution \nchannels.\nThe markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could negatively impact our achievement of revenue \ngrowth.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking \nand communications solutions that offer relative advantages.

  "The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could negatively impact our achievement of revenue \ngrowth.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking \nand communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We \ncompete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product \nsolutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer \nproduct areas, and in key priority areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined \nnetworking (SDN) products, have become more prevalent, we have faced increased competition from companies that develop \nnetworking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as \u201cwhite box\u201d hardware, to the extent customers decide to \npurchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service \nenables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different \ngeographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from \nChina, and we anticipate this will continue. For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d \ncontained in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d of this report.\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product \narea. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are \nregularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering \nresources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but \n16",
  "also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those \nmarkets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have \nstrategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise \ndata center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, \nnetworking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly \nscalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing \nand virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously \nindependent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have \nmade acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions \nfor the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale \nof enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance \npartners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our \ncompetitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\nWe also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer \ntechnology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time \ncompete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, \nand strategic alliance partners could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly \naffect our chances of success. \nIf we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and \nwe may experience increased competition or delays in product development.\nWe have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer \ncomplementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is \ngenerally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the \nexpected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures. If successful, these relationships may be mutually \nbeneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete \nin some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that \ncompany in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as \nexpected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to \nmanage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.\nInventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm \nour gross margins.\nWe must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our \nresults of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory \nis too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our \nproducts and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user \ndemand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for \nchanges in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of \nfocus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory \nobsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related \nchallenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately \ndetermine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could \nresult in lower gross margins.\nOur financial performance may be negatively impacted by demand for, and costs to deliver, our software subscription",
  "challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately \ndetermine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could \nresult in lower gross margins.\nOur financial performance may be negatively impacted by demand for, and costs to deliver, our software subscription \nofferings; and interruptions or performance problems associated with these offerings, including interruptions or \nperformance problems caused by third-party providers on which we rely, may negatively impact our business and financial \nresults. \nIn recent years, we have shifted our business model to deliver more recurring software and subscription offerings. This shift in \nour business model was accelerated by recent acquisitions, including our acquisition of Splunk in the third quarter of fiscal \n2024. Market acceptance of our software subscription offerings, which includes our as-a-service solutions, can be affected by a \nvariety of factors, including: security, reliability, performance, terms of service, support terms, customer preference, community \nengagement, concerns regarding data privacy or data protection, and the enactment of laws or regulations in jurisdictions in \nwhich we operate. To generate sales growth for our software subscription offerings, we need to convince potential customers to \npurchase new licenses or subscriptions and generate timely renewals and additional purchases from existing customers. Any \nfailure to do so could result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, increased churn or otherwise negatively impact our results of \n17",
  "operations and financial condition. Further, growth of our software subscription offerings depends, in part, on the ability of \ncustomers to use and access these solutions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in service, \nstorage failures, and other performance-related problems due to a variety of factors, such as infrastructure and software \nchanges, human or software errors, capacity constraints, unauthorized access, denial of service or other cyber attacks. In some \ninstances, we may not be able to timely identify the cause or causes of these performance problems and, even if timely \nidentified, we may be unable to timely remediate the underlying cause. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and \nimprove our performance for our software subscription offerings, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions \nbecome more complex and our user traffic increases. Performance-related issues of our software subscription offerings may \nresult in increased operational costs, delays in new feature rollouts, customer loss, reputational damage, and legal or regulatory \nliability, including liability under customer contracts or for losses suffered by our customers.\nTo deliver our software subscription offerings, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to implement and \nmaintain this business. We make significant investments to increase or maintain capacity and to develop and implement new \ntechnologies in our infrastructure and operations, including those provided by third-party providers on which we rely. We may \nnot be successful in developing or implementing these technologies. To the extent that we do not effectively scale our \noperations to meet the needs of our customers and to maintain performance as our customers expand their use of our solutions, \nwe may not be able to grow this business as quickly as we anticipate, our customers may reduce or cancel use of our solutions, \nand we may be unable to compete as effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, if our \ncosts associated with our software subscription offerings were to significantly increase, our business, results of operations and \nfinancial condition may be negatively impacted. We are also subject to the risk of performance-related problems or interruption \nof the services provided by third-party providers on which we rely, which could cause revenues for software subscription \nofferings to decline, damage to our reputation, legal liability exposure, and/or increased expenses, all of which could negatively \nimpact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if \nwe fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and \nmarket share may suffer.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new \nproduct and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on \nour ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production \ncosts of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed.\nThe process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology \nrelated to other market transitions\u2014 such as artificial intelligence, security, observability, and cloud\u2014 is complex and \nuncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could \nbe harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to \ndeveloping new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market \nwill accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking, security, or observability does not emerge as we believe \nit will, or these industries do not evolve as we believe they will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, \nmany of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products \nrelated to these markets in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on \ntechnology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could \nbe harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings \naddressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from",
  "technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could \nbe harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings \naddressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from \nours. In addition, our business could be negatively impacted in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers \ndelay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been seeking to meet the \nevolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to \nconsume them. As a part of these efforts, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver \nour technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or \nthe architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and \nhow we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed.\nFurthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning \nand timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result \nin competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of \nmarket share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new \ncompetitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new \nproduct and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, \ndifferentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and \n18",
  "services. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and \nbring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or \nthat products, services and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or \nnoncompetitive. The products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority areas may not prove to have the \nmarket success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services.\nChanges in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our \nproducts or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to \nconsider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment \nin or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology-\nrelated write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims \nfrom third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate \nrecoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such \nassessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and \nadjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include \nliabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the \nliabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform \ngoodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill \nimpairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. From time to time we initiate restructuring plans. Our business may not be \nmore efficient or effective than prior to implementation of such plans. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges \nand the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial \ncondition.\nOver the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority areas, and \nthese investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results.\nWhile we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and \nother resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key \npriority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity. We also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in core networking and \nservices. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, \nand the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the \nbenefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), \nor if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be negatively impacted.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating \nresults.\nOur growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new \nproducts on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products \nthrough acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, \nincluding the following:\n\u2022\nDifficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems, technologies, products, and \npersonnel of the acquired companies, particularly with companies that have large and widespread operations and/or \ncomplex products (such as Splunk)\n\u2022\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing \nlarger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions\n\u2022\nPotential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process research and development intangibles\n\u2022\nDifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in \nsuch markets have stronger market positions\n\u2022",

Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially \nharm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful \nintroduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and \nmarketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition \ndue diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax \nrate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks described with respect to new \nproduct development also apply to acquisitions.\nEntrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our \nservice and support operations.\nAs we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity, we compete with \ncompanies of all sizes. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, \nthan we do. Additionally, as customers complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, \nand financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, \nor financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and \nfinancing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject \nus to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer \nconfidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face \nincreased legal and regulatory requirements.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. \nSoftware typically contains bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can unexpectedly interfere with its intended \noperations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software is installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-\nshipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that \ncould affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross \nmargins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of \ndefects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product \ninvolved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure of a product \nline, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, product \nreengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.\nDue to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region \ncould harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world.

Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in \norders in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries \nand there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be negatively \nimpacted by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, any \nor all of which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition, including the following: impacts from \n20",
  "global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship between the United States and other countries \nthat can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies \nheadquartered in the United States or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to \nthose components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic \nenvironment; foreign currency exchange rates; geopolitical tensions (including China-Taiwan relations); political or social \nunrest; economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in \nChina and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; environmental protection regulations (including new \nlaws and regulations related to climate change); trade protection measures, such as tariffs; other legal and regulatory \nrequirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from, or sell our products in \nvarious countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service provider and \ngovernment spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics; difficulties in staffing and managing \ninternational operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global \noperations.\nIssues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, \ndamage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.\nWe currently incorporate AI technology in certain of our products and services and in our business operations. Our research and \ndevelopment of such technology remains ongoing. AI presents risks and challenges and may result in unintended consequences \nthat could affect its further development or our and our customers\u2019 adoption and use of this technology. AI algorithms and \ntraining methodologies may be flawed. Additionally, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant \ncompetition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies. Leveraging AI capabilities to potentially \nimprove our internal functions and operations also presents further risks, costs, and challenges. While we aim to develop and \nuse AI responsibly and attempt to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in \nidentifying or resolving issues before they arise. The AI-related legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and may be \ninconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could \nentail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings. AI-related issues, deficiencies \nand/or failures could also give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI \nin jurisdictions such as the European Union and others, and as a result of new applications of existing data protection, privacy, \nintellectual property, and other laws; damage our reputation; or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result \nin material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States, and, because of local \ncustoms or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also \nexperienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may \ninclude not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs \nassociated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our \nfinancing activities may increase if our customers are negatively impacted by a global economic downturn or periods of \neconomic uncertainty. There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be \neffective. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease \nfinancing arrangements, particularly among internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial \nlosses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to \ndate, future losses, if incurred, could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the",

Although these losses have not been material to \ndate, future losses, if incurred, could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, to the \ndegree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers\u2019 \nability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial \ncondition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our \ninvestments could harm our earnings.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt \ninvestments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market \nprice declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair \nvalue of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. \nThese investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are \ntypically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.

  "We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in \nforeign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase \nin the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States \nwhere we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw \nmaterials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as \nbusiness practices evolve, and they could materially harm our financial results and cash flows.\nFailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and \nmarketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California and \nother major United States locations. Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions \nand provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity \nincentive awards, or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the \nmanagement of share dilution and share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also negatively impact our ability to \nretain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the \nUnited States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key \npersonnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly \nin engineering and sales fields, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product \nintroductions. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that \ncompetitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional \nclaims in the future.\nAdverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Any litigation can be costly, lengthy, and disruptive to normal \nbusiness operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of \nlawsuits or governmental investigations could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. For \nadditional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial \nStatements, subsection (f) \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur operating results may be negatively impacted and damage to our reputation may occur due to the production and sale of \ncounterfeit versions of our products.\nAs is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit \nversions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the \nmanufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have \nsucceeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be \nno guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have \notherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they \nreplace otherwise legitimate sales, could negatively impact our operating results.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could \nnegatively impact our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be negatively impacted by earnings being lower than \nanticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes \nin the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible \nlow-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate \nalternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer",
  "in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible \nlow-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate \nalternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer \npricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by \ntax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, \ntreaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of \nexpenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the \nrecognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the \nUnited States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing \njurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that \nthese changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our \nprovision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and \n22",
  "commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could \nadversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax \nreturns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes \nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that \nthe outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial \ncondition.\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events \n(including as a result of global climate change).\nOur corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area \nof Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near \nrivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our customers, suppliers and logistics centers are located in \nregions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding or other weather-related activity which in the \npast has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of supply chain components and delivery of products. In addition, \nglobal climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as \ndrought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, changing precipitation, and flooding. We have not to date experienced a material event \nas a result of these kinds of natural disasters; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could materially harm our \nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition.\nTerrorism, war, and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto, or any other current or future \nacts of terrorism, war (such as the on-going Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war), and other events (such as economic \nsanctions, trade restrictions and reactions of the governments, markets and the general public, including the sanctions and \nrestrictions related to the on-going Russia-Ukraine war) may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and \nother countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results, and \nfinancial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or \ntelecommunications could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or \ncancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial \ncondition could be materially harmed.\nThere can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be negatively impacted by our \nincurrence of debt. \nAs of the end of fiscal 2024, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $20.3 billion that \nmature at specific dates from calendar year 2025 through 2064. We have also established a commercial paper program under \nwhich we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate \namount outstanding at any time of $15.0 billion. We had $10.9 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding under this \nprogram as of July 27, 2024. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt, including any \nadditional debt to refinance maturing debt, will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing \ncash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness \nwill not negatively impact our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit \nrating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we \nmay borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances.\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and \ngovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, \ngoals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and social",
  "Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social, and \ngovernance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate certain ESG-related initiatives, \ngoals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and social \ninvestments, and other matters, in our annual Purpose Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These \ninitiatives, goals, or commitments involve risks and uncertainties and could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. For \nexample, in September 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by \n2040, the achievement of which relies, in large part, on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced \npower efficiency of our products, the adoption of renewable energy at customer and supplier sites, and the adoption of certain \nof our products and services by our customers. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our 2040 net zero \ngoal or other ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature \nof these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary \ndisclosures about ESG matters increase, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. \nOur actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our \nreputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\n23",
  "Risks Related to Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce.\nWe generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our \ntechnology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, \nthere can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or \ncircumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of \nnetworking technology are governed by industry-wide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can \nbe no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently \nbroad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the \nsame extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different \nthan if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual \npatents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our \nproprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, \nwe may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort \nrequired to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful.\nWe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others.\nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive \npatent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. \nThese assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims \nassertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the \nsecrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible \nto determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The \nasserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging \ninfringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. \nRegardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and \nmanagement personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are \nmade by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance \nthat licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be \nadequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential \nfor high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled \nfor significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, \nif we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing \ntechnology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, \nand financial condition could be materially harmed. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see \nNote 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of \nintellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development \nprocess with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third \nparties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our \nacquisition.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses.\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be \nnecessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the",

There can be no assurance that the \nnecessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to \nobtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could materially \nharm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other \nintellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights \nin our products.\n24",
  "Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Privacy, and Regulatory Requirements\nCyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents impacting our solutions and IT environment may disrupt our operations, \nharm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; \nand cyber attacks, data breaches or other incidents on our customers\u2019 or third-party providers\u2019 networks, or in third-party \nproducts we use, could result in claims of liability against us, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our \nreputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access on a regular basis to (i) our products and services \n(together, our \u201csolutions\u201d) and (ii) the servers, data centers, networks, systems, and cloud-based services operated or enabled by \nus, or by third parties upon which we rely, on or through which our and third-party data are stored, processed, or can be \naccessed (collectively, our \u201cIT environment\u201d). We anticipate continuing to be increasingly subject to such attempts as cyber \nattacks become more sophisticated and difficult to predict and protect against. Despite our active implementation of security \nand other measures, our solutions and IT environment have been, and continue to be, vulnerable to cyber attacks, incidents, data \nbreaches, malware, inadvertent error, disruptions, failures, physical security breaches, tampering or other theft or misuse, \nincluding by employees, contingent workers, and malicious actors. Additionally, nation-state actors or their agents have in the \npast successfully attacked our IT environment and have also exploited vulnerabilities in our solutions to carry out attacks, and \nwe anticipate that these attacks and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in our solutions will continue and may intensify during \nperiods of diplomatic or armed conflict. Further, a cyber attack or other incident could go undetected and persist in our \nenvironments for extended periods. Cyber-related events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, the \ndisruption of access to, or the operation of our solutions and IT environment or those of our customers or third-party providers \nupon which we rely, or result in confidential information stored on our systems or our customers\u2019 or other third-party systems \nbeing improperly accessed, processed, disclosed now (or in the future), or be lost or stolen. Efforts to limit the ability of \nmalicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our security efforts are costly to implement and may not \nbe successful. Breaches of security in our IT environment, our customers\u2019 or third-party providers\u2019 networks, or in third-party \nproducts we use, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our solutions, a failure by us to timely \nmitigate or apply a security fix for products we use that are found vulnerable, or a failure to maintain the digital security \ninfrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity of our solutions and IT environment, could, in each case, result in \nclaims of legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. The \noccurrence of a cyber attack, data breach or other incident could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, \nbusiness partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or could \notherwise negatively impact our business, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial \ncondition.\nVulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, \nfailure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security updates in a \ntimely manner or deciding not to upgrade our solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, \nor otherwise materially harm our business.\nThe products and services (together, our \u201csolutions\u201d) we sell to customers, and the cloud-based services operated or enabled by \nus, or by third parties upon which we rely, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or security defects (despite our efforts to prevent \nand detect them through secure development lifecycle practices, testing, and other means), which have not been remedied or \ncannot be disclosed without compromising security. We also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities \nor security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes.

Even when we prioritize a vulnerability or security defect, in certain \ninstances it has taken, and in the future could take, time for us to develop a remedy and the remedy may ultimately be \ninsufficient to fully fix the issue. In addition, workarounds or other mitigation efforts in certain instances have not been, and in \nthe future may not be, available or sufficient to protect customers prior to a security update being made available. \nVulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security updates if we have not identified and addressed the root cause of a \nparticular vulnerability, if customers have not installed the most recent updates, if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities \nbefore a security update is applied to install additional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems, or if a previously \npatched vulnerability is inadvertently reintroduced due to a security regression during future development. Additionally, \ncustomers may also need to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. When \ncustomers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, use solutions that are end of life and no longer receive security \nupdates, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our solutions containing the security update, they are left vulnerable. \nIn addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based services on which our and third-party data is stored or \nprocessed, and we cannot control the timing at which third-party providers remedy vulnerabilities, which could leave us \nvulnerable.

  "security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade solutions could, in each case, result in claims of legal and/or \nregulatory action against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise materially harm our business.\nOur actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of legal and/or regulatory action \nagainst us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nGlobal privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving, extensive, and complex. Compliance with these \nlaws and regulations is difficult and costly. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, \nprocessing, or cross-border transmission of data, including for regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our \ncustomers\u2019 ability to use, and our ability to sell, our products and services. The interpretation and application of these laws in \nsome instances is uncertain, and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes. For example, the \nEuropean Union\u2019s (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) applies to our activities conducted from an \nestablishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU and imposes a range of compliance obligations \nregarding the handling of personal data. Additionally, we are subject to California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, Singapore\u2019s \nPersonal Data Protection Act, and other laws, regulations and obligations that relate to the handling of personal data. Our actual \nor perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to personal data, or to protect \npersonal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could subject us to liability to our customers, data subjects, \nsuppliers, business partners, employees, and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or \ncould otherwise negatively impact our business, any of which could materially harm our operating results and financial \ncondition.\nOur business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or \nobligations applicable to our products and services.\nChanges in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries and sectors in which we operate, in the United States and in \nother countries, could materially affect the sales and use of our products and services. In particular, economic sanctions and \nchanges to export and import control requirements have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our \nproducts and services in certain jurisdictions. In addition, changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service \nprovider customers\u2019 purchase of our products and services, and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings. \nGovernment procurement policies, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or other obligations often give rise to \nevolving privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, or other requirements, and the failure or delay to meet and maintain such \nrequirements could negatively impact our business, including by limiting our ability to sell products and services, directly or \nindirectly, to public sector, critical infrastructure and other customers. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of \nour products and services include laws, regulations, or customer procurement requirements related to encryption technology, \ndata, artificial intelligence, privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, environmental sustainability (including climate \nchange), human rights, product certification, product accessibility, country of origin, and national security controls applicable to \nour supply chain. Changes in regulatory requirements or our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and \nregulations or other obligations could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nHistorically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our \nactual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. \nFurthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of \noperations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price.

  "Fiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023\nIn fiscal 2024, total revenue decreased by 6% compared with fiscal 2023. In March 2024, we completed the acquisition of \nSplunk Inc. (\u201cSplunk\u201d), which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue for fiscal 2024. Within total revenue, \nproduct revenue decreased by 9% and services revenue increased by 5%. In fiscal 2024, total software revenue was $18.4 \nbillion across all product areas and services, an increase of 9%, driven by the contribution of Splunk. Total subscription revenue \nincreased 11%, partially driven by the contribution of Splunk. \nDuring the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we experienced a decline in product demand as customers continued to scrutinize \nspend as they needed additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. In the fourth \nquarter of fiscal 2024 we saw improvement in product demand across all geographic segments and customer markets as \ncustomers largely completed the installation of their product shipments. While we continue to operate in a highly competitive \nenvironment and the overall macroeconomic environment remains challenging and uncertain, we plan to continue to invest in \nkey priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term.\nTotal gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points. Product gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points, largely driven \nby favorable product mix, productivity benefits and benefits from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As \na percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, \nincreased by 4.4 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points driven \nprimarily by incremental operating expenses from Splunk, higher restructuring and other charges and higher amortization of \npurchased intangible assets in fiscal 2024. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 17%, driven by a decrease of 18% in net \nincome partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 43 million shares. \nIn terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.5 billion, EMEA revenue decreased by $1.0 \nbillion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.7 billion. We experienced a product revenue decline in the enterprise \nand service provider and cloud markets. Product revenue in the public sector market was flat. From a product category \nperspective, total product revenue decreased 9% year over year, driven by a decline in revenue in Networking of 15%, partially \noffset by growth in Security of 32% and Observability of 27%, each driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk. Product \nrevenue grew in Collaboration by 2%.\nWe remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital \ntransformations and on accelerating innovation across our portfolio.

  "Fourth Quarter Snapshot\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, total revenue decreased by 10%. \nWithin total revenue, product revenue decreased by 15% and services revenue increased by 6%. With regard to our geographic \nsegment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in Americas decreased by 11%, EMEA decreased by 11% and APJC \ndecreased by 6%. From a product category perspective, we experienced a product revenue decline in Networking, partially \noffset by growth in Security and Observability, driven in large part by the contribution of Splunk. Product revenue in \nCollaboration was flat. Total gross margin increased by 0.3 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and the \ncontribution from Splunk, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and \ndevelopment, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 8.1 percentage points. \nOperating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 8.8 percentage points primarily driven by incremental operating \nexpenses from Splunk and higher amortization of purchased intangible assets. Diluted earnings per share decreased by 44%, \ndriven by a decrease in net income of 45%, partially offset by a decrease in diluted share count of 58 million shares.\nStrategy and Priorities\nAcross the globe, businesses and organizations of every size are leveraging Cisco technology to transform and drive better \noutcomes and experiences.

  "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in \nthe United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the \nConsolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the \nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting \npolicies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant \njudgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results \ncould differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.\nRevenue Recognition \nWe enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally \ndistinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance \nobligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or \nservice on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the \nproduct or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, \nperpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple \nobligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, \nwe are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that \nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the \ncustomer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is \navailable for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can \nalso occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our \nhardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon \ntransfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized \nupfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as \nservices and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of \nthe software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue \nrecognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration \nfrom shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be \nentitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct \nperformance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price \nof a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where \nSSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable \ninputs. \nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in \nidentifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration \nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and \nvarious rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and \ncustomers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying \nthe expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes \navailable. We also consider the customers\u2019 right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual \ncredits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on",

When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying \nthe expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes \navailable. We also consider the customers\u2019 right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual \ncredits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on \nhistorical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. \nInventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\nInventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories, determined primarily by future demand forecasts. \nInventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value, based upon \nassumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At \n34\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",
  "the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and \ncircumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and \nsuppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete \ninventory.\nOur provision for inventory was $576 million, $307 million, and $102 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The \nprovision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $243 million, $423 \nmillion, and $227 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in \ndemand for our products, if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or \ncustomer requirements, or if supply constraints were to continue, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, \nand our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability, could \nbe adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs, and the adequacy of our liability for \npurchase commitments. For further discussion around the supply chain impacts and risks, see \u201c\u2014Results of Operations\u2014Gross \nMargin\u2014Supply Chain Impacts and Risks\u201d and \u201c\u2014Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014Inventory Supply Chain\u201d under Item 7 of \nthis report.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the \nincurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An \nestimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be \nreasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or \nadjusted and whether new accruals are required. \nThird parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive \npatent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. \nThese assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims \nassertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third \nparty is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially \nreasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely \naffected.\nValuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets \nGoodwill\nOur methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation \ntechniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as \nan excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company \nover the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an \nannual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The \nassessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in \nan orderly transaction in accordance with the guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets.\nIn response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and \nconsider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There \nwas no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2024, the excess of \nthe fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $47.0 billion for the Americas, $65.9 billion for \nEMEA, and $25.3 billion for APJC. \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of \nour respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not \nresult in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. \nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe accounting for acquisitions requires significant estimates and judgments in the valuation of purchased intangible assets.",
  "During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of \nour respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not \nresult in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. \nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe accounting for acquisitions requires significant estimates and judgments in the valuation of purchased intangible assets. \nCritical estimates used in the valuation of purchased intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of \nexpected future cash flows, useful lives and discount rates. While our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are \n35\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",
  "believed to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and would not reflect unanticipated \nevents and circumstances that may occur.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured \nby comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to \ngenerate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the \ndifference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values \nand remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of \nfactors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business \nstrategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment \ncharges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. \nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the \nstatutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible \nincome deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, and international \nrealignments. Our effective tax rate was 15.6%, 17.7%, and 18.4% in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. \nAlthough we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not \nbe different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light \nof changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the \nfinal tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income \ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve \nprovisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing \nthe need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future \ntaxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. If we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax \nassets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income \ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated \nin countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the \nvaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible \nlow-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax, research and development capitalization and amortization, and corporate \nalternative minimum tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer \npricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by \ntax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, \ntreaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of \nexpenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the \nrecognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The OECD, an \ninternational association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a Pillar Two \nframework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction, and is contemplating additional changes to \nnumerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized,",

Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are \nsubject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities.

During fiscal 2024, we saw customers \nscrutinizing spend and needing additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. \nRevenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, primarily driven by declines in our Catalyst 9000 series \nand Nexus 9000 series offerings. We experienced a revenue decline in enterprise routing, although we saw revenue growth in \nour SD-WAN offerings. The decrease in wireless was primarily driven by our WiFi-6 products and Meraki offerings. We also \nsaw a revenue decline in routed optical networking.\nFiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022\nRevenue from the Networking product category increased by 18%, or $5.3 billion. Revenue grew in both campus switching and \ndata center switching. This was primarily driven by strong growth in our Catalyst 9000 series, Nexus 9000 series and Meraki \nswitching offerings. The increase in enterprise routing was primarily driven by growth in Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN and \nIoT routing offerings. Wireless grew primarily driven by our WiFi-6 products and Meraki offerings. Revenue in routed optical \nnetworking was flat, primarily driven by growth in our Core routing portfolio, including our Cisco 8000 series offerings and \ngrowth in our webscale provider market.\nSecurity\nFiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023\nThe Security product category consists of our Network Security, Identity and Access Management, SASE and Threat \nIntelligence, Detection, and Response offerings. Revenue in our Security product category increased by 32%, or $1.2 billion, \nprimarily driven by the contribution of Splunk offerings and growth across the portfolio. The Security product category grew \n4%, not including the contribution from Splunk offerings.\nFiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022\nRevenue in the Security product category increased by 4%, or $160 million, primarily driven by growth in our Secure Access \nService Edge and Zero Trust offerings.\nCollaboration\nFiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023\nThe Collaboration product category consists of our Webex Suite, Collaboration Devices, Contact Center and CPaaS offerings. \nRevenue in our Collaboration product category increased 2%, or $61 million, primarily driven by growth across the portfolio, \nexcept our Meetings offering.\n39\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",
  "Fiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022\nRevenue in the Collaboration product category decreased 9%, or $420 million, primarily driven by declines in Collaboration \nDevices and Meetings, partially offset by growth in our Calling and Contact Center offerings.\nObservability\nFiscal 2024 Compared with Fiscal 2023\nThe Observability product category consists of our network assurance, monitoring and analytics and observability suite \nofferings. Revenue in our Observability product category increased by 27%, or $176 million, driven by growth in our \nThousandEyes offering and the contribution from Observability Suite, our Splunk offering. Product revenue in the \nObservability product category increased 15%, not including the contribution from Splunk.\nFiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022\nRevenue in our Observability product category increased 14%, or $80 million, driven by growth in our ThousandEyes and \nmonitoring and analytics offerings.\nServices Revenue by Segment\nThe following table presents the breakdown of services revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages):\nYears Ended\n2024 vs. 2023\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nVariance in \nDollars\nVariance in \nPercent\nServices revenue:\n \n \n \n \n \nAmericas    .......................................................... $ \n8,829 \n$ \n8,427 \n$ \n8,194 \n$ \n402 \n 5 %\nPercentage of service revenue  ..................................\n 60.7 %\n 60.8 %\n 60.5 %\nEMEA   ..............................................................  \n3,472 \n \n3,269 \n \n3,171 \n \n203 \n 6 %\nPercentage of service revenue  ..................................\n 23.9 %\n 23.6 %\n 23.4 %\nAPJC       ................................................................  \n2,249 \n \n2,160 \n \n2,173 \n \n89 \n 4 %\nPercentage of service revenue  ..................................\n 15.5 %\n 15.6 %\n 16.0 %\nTotal   ............................................................. $ \n14,550 \n$ \n13,856 \n$ \n13,539 \n$ \n694 \n 5 %\nAmounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.  \nServices revenue increased 5%, driven by growth in our solution support, advisory services and software support offerings.

This was partially offset by the amortization of \npurchased intangible assets primarily related to Splunk, and negative impacts from pricing.\nSupply Chain Impacts and Risks\nIn past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints. \nThese supply constraints resulted in the need to secure long-term supply and increased inventory supply chain balances \ncompared to historical levels. This in turn has significantly increased our supply chain exposure, which has resulted in negative \nimpacts to our product gross margin in recent periods and may result in further negative impacts in future periods. This \nexposure includes potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a \nsustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to \nmitigate the remaining supply chain exposures.\nServices Gross Margin\nOur services gross margin percentage increased by 1.7 percentage points primarily due to higher sales volume, lower \nheadcount-related and delivery costs, lower variable compensation expense and favorable mix of service offerings.\nOur services gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract \ninitiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service \nbusiness. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower \nthan the gross margin from technical support services.\n41\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",

These increases were partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets that became fully amortized. The impairment \ncharges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future \ncash flows associated with certain of our IPR&D intangible assets.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nWe recognized total restructuring and other charges, included in operating expenses, of $789 million and $531 million in fiscal \n2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we announced a restructuring plan in order to allow us to invest in key growth opportunities \nand drive more efficiencies in our business. This restructuring plan is expected to impact approximately 7% of our global \nworkforce. The total pre-tax charges are estimated to be up to $1 billion. We expect this plan to be substantially completed by \nthe end of fiscal 2025.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to realign the organization and enable further \ninvestment in key priority areas, of which approximately 5% of our global workforce would be impacted. In connection with \nthis plan, we incurred charges of $654 million for fiscal 2024 and the plan is substantially complete.\nIn fiscal 2023, we announced a restructuring plan in order to rebalance the organization and enable further investment in key \npriority areas. We incurred cumulative charges of $670 million and completed this plan in fiscal 2024.\nWe expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring plans in our key priority areas and key \ngrowth opportunities.

We expect lower interest income in future periods due to a lower average balance of \ncash and available-for-sale debt investments and higher interest expense due to the higher outstanding balance of debt.\nOther Income (Loss), Net   The components of other income (loss), net, are summarized as follows (in millions):\nYears Ended\n2024 vs. 2023\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nVariance \nin Dollars\nGains (losses) on investments, net:\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments     ............................. $ \n(67) $\n(21) $\n9 $ \n(46) \nMarketable equity investments     .....................................\n65\n37\n(38)\n28\nPrivately held investments     ............................................\n(164)\n(193)\n486  \n29\nNet gains (losses) on investments   ..........................\n(166)\n(177)\n457  \n11\nOther gains (losses), net    .......................................................\n(140)\n(71)\n(65)\n(69)\nOther income (loss), net  ............................... $ \n(306) $\n(248) $\n392 $ \n(58)\nThe change in our other income (loss), net was primarily driven by higher losses in our available-for-sale debt investments and \nunfavorable impacts from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher gains on our marketable equity investments and lower net \nlosses on our privately held investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes \nThe provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.6% for fiscal 2024, compared with 17.7% for fiscal 2023. \nThe net 2.1 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits relating \nto prior year return-to-provision true up and an increase in stock-based compensation windfall benefit.\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our \nprovision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n44\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",
  "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock \nrepurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity \nand capital resources.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Investments  The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in \nmillions):\n   \nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nIncrease \n(Decrease)\nCash and cash equivalents     ............................................................................... $ \n7,508 $ \n10,123 $ \n(2,615) \nAvailable-for-sale debt investments    ................................................................  \n9,865  \n15,592  \n(5,727) \nMarketable equity securities    ............................................................................  \n481  \n431  \n50 \nTotal    ............................................................................................................ $ \n17,854 $ \n26,146 $ \n(8,292) \nThe net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by a net \noutflow for the acquisition of Splunk of $27.5 billion, cash returned to stockholders in the form of cash dividends of $6.4 billion \nand repurchases of common stock of $5.8 billion, repayment of debt of $1.8 billion, net cash paid for our other acquisitions, \nexcluding Splunk, of $1.3 billion and capital expenditures of $0.7 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by the \nissuance of senior notes for net proceeds of $13.4 billion, net cash provided by operating activities of $10.9 billion and net \nissuances of commercial paper notes of $10.8 billion. The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 includes \nthe fiscal 2023 federal tax payment of $2.8 billion that was deferred by the IRS as a result of the California floods and the U.S. \ntransition tax payment of $1.4 billion.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term \ninvestments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our \nportfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high \nquality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to \nuse our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing \nactivities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed \nbelow.\nSecurities Lending  We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt \ninvestments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned \nonly on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that \nthe collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with \nhighly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. \nWe did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of \nJuly 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our \nfree cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The \nfollowing table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):\nYears Ended\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities    ....................................................... $ \n10,880 $ \n19,886 $ \n13,226 \nAcquisition of property and equipment    ...........................................................  \n(670)  \n(849)  \n(477) \nFree cash flow     ................................................................................................. $ \n10,210 $ \n19,037 $ \n12,749 \nWe expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including \nfluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment \nlinearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, \n45\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.",

  "deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk \nFactors\u201d in this report.\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of \nour intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We \nfurther regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our \nbusiness, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting \ncapital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the \nfree cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other \nrequired uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure \ncalculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an \nalternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and \nother companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. \nThe following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases (in millions, except per-share amounts):\nDIVIDENDS\nSTOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nTOTAL\nYears Ended\nPer Share\nAmount\nShares\nWeighted-Average \nPrice per Share\nAmount\nAmount\nJuly 27, 2024       ..................\n$ \n1.58 $ \n6,384  \n117 $ \n49.45 $ \n5,764 $ \n12,148 \nJuly 29, 2023    ...................\n$ \n1.54 $ \n6,302  \n88 $ \n48.49 $ \n4,271 $ \n10,573 \nJuly 30, 2022    ...................\n$ \n1.50 $ \n6,224  \n146 $ \n52.82 $ \n7,734 $ \n13,958 \nOn August 14, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share to be paid on October 23, \n2024, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 2, 2024.

  "Inventory as of July 27, 2024 decreased by 7% and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers \ndecreased by 29% from our balances at the end of fiscal 2023. The combined decrease of 22% in our inventory and inventory \npurchase commitments as compared with the end of fiscal 2023 was primarily due to our continued efforts to work with \ncontract manufacturers and suppliers to optimize our inventory and purchase commitment levels.\nWe have increased our levels of inventory in order to help mitigate risks in our supply chain. We also began increasing our \ninventory supply chain balances starting in fiscal 2021 in order to address significant supply constraints seen industry-wide. The \nincreases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments \nwith contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended lead times, as well as advance payments with \nsuppliers to secure future supply, as a result of the supply constraints. Our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory \nand related losses are further outlined in the Result of Operations\u2014Product Gross Margin section.\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services \nfor our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate \ncomponent supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory \nbased upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing \nmanufacturing capacity. \nOur inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to \nsuppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our inventory purchase commitments are entered into directly with \nsuppliers and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year \nperiods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, \nand unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our \nrequirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed.\nInventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to \nhelp ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints, rapidly changing \ntechnology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is \nappropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels.\nFinancing Receivables and Guarantees  The following table summarizes our financing receivables (in millions):\n   \nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nIncrease \n(Decrease)\nLoan receivables, net    ...................................................................................... $ \n5,808 $ \n5,857 $ \n(49) \nLease receivables, net     .....................................................................................  \n906  \n978  \n(72) \nTotal, net    ................................................................................................. $ \n6,714 $ \n6,835 $ \n(121) \nFinancing Receivables  Our financing arrangements include loans and leases. Our loan receivables include customer financing \nfor purchases of our hardware, software and services (including technical support and advanced services), and also may include \nadditional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Lease \nreceivables include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the \nunderlying assets. Financing receivables decreased by 2% as compared with the end of fiscal 2023.\nFinancing Guarantees  In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers \nand channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and \nloans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and \nloan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third \nparties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a \ntransfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true \nsales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.",

We could be called upon to make payments \nunder these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. Historically, our payments under these \narrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner \nfinancing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the \nguarantees.

As a \nresult of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we \nmay not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\nWe provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel \npartners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel \npartners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under \u201cFinancing Receivables and Guarantees.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\nBased on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated \nfrom operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 \nmonths, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs (including \ninventory and other supply related payments), capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, \ncontractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer \nfinancings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or \nrelationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the \navailability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources.  \n50\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)",
  "Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency \nexchange risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Investments  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our \nprimary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with \npreserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact \non the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates, including the impact \nfrom lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. Our available-\nfor-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as \nof July 27, 2024. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to \nindividual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong.\nThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging \neffects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes \nreflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus \n150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023 are as follows (in millions):\n \nVALUATION OF SECURITIES\nGIVEN AN INTEREST RATE\nDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS\nFAIR VALUE\nAS OF \nJULY 27, 2024\nVALUATION OF SECURITIES\nGIVEN AN INTEREST RATE\nINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS\n \n(150 BPS)\n(100 BPS)\n(50 BPS)\n50 BPS\n100 BPS\n150 BPS\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments    .....\n$10,057\n$9,993\n$9,929\n$9,865\n$9,800\n$9,736\n$9,672\n \nVALUATION OF SECURITIES\nGIVEN AN INTEREST RATE\nDECREASE OF X BASIS POINTS\nFAIR VALUE\nAS OF \nJULY 29, 2023\nVALUATION OF SECURITIES\nGIVEN AN INTEREST RATE\nINCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS\n \n(150 BPS)\n(100 BPS)\n(50 BPS)\n50 BPS\n100 BPS\n150 BPS\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments     .....\n$15,901\n$15,798\n$15,695\n$15,592\n$15,489\n$15,386\n$15,284\nFinancing Receivables  As of July 27, 2024, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $6.7 billion, compared with $6.8 \nbillion as of July 29, 2023. As of July 27, 2024, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would \nchange the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. \nDebt   As of July 27, 2024, we had $20.3 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying \namount of the senior notes was $20.1 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $20.4 billion. As of July 27, \n2024, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, \nexcluding the $0.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.7 billion, respectively. However, this \nhypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged.\nAt any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could cause us to incur additional interest expense to the extent we issue \nadditional commercial paper or other debt.\nEquity Price Risk\nMarketable Equity Investments  The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We \nhold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for \npurposes other than trading. The total fair value of our marketable equity securities was $481 million and $431 million as of \nJuly 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\nPrivately Held Investments  These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 27, \n2024, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments were each $1.8 billion at July 27, 2024 and \nJuly 29, 2023. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are \ninherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early \nstages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately held \ninvestments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their \ntechnologies and potential for financial return. \n51",
  "Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in \nmillions):\n \nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\n \nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nNotional Amount\nFair Value\nForward contracts:\nPurchased   ...................................................................... $ \n3,586 $ \n(59) $ \n3,014 $ \n(33) \nSold     ............................................................................... $ \n3,848 $ \n60 $ \n2,406 $ \n31 \nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not \nbeen material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to \nother currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products \nto non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise \nindirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in \naddition to the impact of such currency fluctuations.\nApproximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2024, foreign currency fluctuations, net of \nhedging, increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $30 million, or 0.2%, as \ncompared with fiscal 2023. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar \ndenominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency \noptions and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time \nhorizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of \nexposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains \nand losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost \nof sales.\nWe also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency \nfluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. \nThe market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our \nforecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for \nspeculative purposes.\n52",

  "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. \nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as \nof July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of equity \nand of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 27, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred \nto as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as \nof July 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \nposition of the Company as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of \nthe three years in the period ended July 27, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \nStates of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over \nfinancial reporting as of July 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued \nby the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal \ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included \nin the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express \nopinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting \nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities \nlaws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, \nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material \nrespects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. \nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Splunk Inc. \n(\u201cSplunk\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of July 27, 2024, because it was acquired by the \nCompany in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded Splunk from our audit of internal control \nover financial reporting. Splunk is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from \nmanagement\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 3% and 3%, \nrespectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended July 27, 2024.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally",
  "respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended July 27, 2024.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \nthat (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n54",
  "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or \ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate \nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition for Certain Product and Services Revenue \nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives revenue from contracts with customers \nthat can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate \nperformance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract \nwith a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or \nservices. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, \nelectronic delivery (or when the software is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has \ntransferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer \nreceives the benefit over the contract term. In certain customer arrangements, management applies judgment in identifying \ncontractual terms and determining the transaction price and management may be required to estimate variable consideration \nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. For the year ended July 27, 2024, the Company\u2019s total revenue was \n$53.8 billion, of which the majority relates to certain product and services revenue.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for certain \nproduct and services revenue is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in identifying contractual \nterms in certain customer arrangements and a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and \nevaluating audit evidence relating to revenue recognition for certain product and services revenue.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall \nopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the \nrevenue recognition process, including obtaining an understanding of management\u2019s process for identifying and evaluating \nterms and conditions in certain customer arrangements and evaluating management\u2019s determination of the impact of those terms \nand conditions on revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, (a) the \ncompleteness and accuracy of management\u2019s identification and evaluation of terms and conditions by examining customer \narrangements; (b) management\u2019s process for determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue recognition based on \nthe contractual terms identified in customer arrangements; (c) revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source \ndocuments, such as contracts, purchase orders, invoices, and proof of delivery; and (d) the timing of recognition of revenue \ntransactions.\nAcquisition of Splunk \u2014 Valuation of Customer Contracts and Related Relationships Asset and the Technology Asset Acquired\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 18, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of \nSplunk for total consideration of approximately $27 billion. The Company acquired $10.6 billion of intangible assets in \nconnection with the acquisition. Of these acquired intangible assets, $6.1 billion of customer-related assets were recorded, of \nwhich the majority relates to customer contracts and related relationships, and $3.9 billion for a technology asset was recorded.  \nThe customer contracts and related relationships asset was valued using the with-and-without method under the income \napproach. The technology asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The",

The technology asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. The \npresent value of projected future cash flows included significant judgment and assumptions regarding projected future revenues, \nprojected expenses, attrition rates, the revenue build up period, and the discount rate for the customer contracts and related \nrelationships asset and projected future revenues, projected expenses, the technology obsolescence rate, and the discount rate \nfor the technology asset.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the customer \ncontracts and related relationships asset and the technology asset acquired in connection with the acquisition of Splunk is a \ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer-\nrelated and technology assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures \nand evaluating management\u2019s significant assumptions related to projected future revenues, projected expenses, attrition rates, \nthe revenue build up period, and the discount rate for the customer contracts and related relationships asset and projected future \nrevenues, projected expenses, the technology obsolescence rate, and the discount rate for the technology asset; and (iii) the audit \neffort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n55",

These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the \nacquisition accounting, including controls over management\u2019s valuation of the customer contracts and related relationships \nasset and the technology asset acquired. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) \ntesting management\u2019s process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer contracts and related relationships asset \nand the technology asset; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach methods used by management; (iv) testing \nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the income approach methods; and (v) evaluating the \nreasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to projected future revenues, projected expenses, \nattrition rates, the revenue build up period, and the discount rate for the  customer contracts and related relationships asset and \nprojected future revenues, projected expenses, the technology obsolescence rate, and the discount rate for the technology asset. \nEvaluating management\u2019s assumptions related to projected future revenues, projected expenses, attrition rates, the revenue build \nup period, and the technology obsolescence rate involved considering (i) the current and past performance of Splunk; (ii) the \nconsistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in \nother areas of the audit.

  "CISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cCisco,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last \nSaturday in July. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial \nStatements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been \neliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic \nsegments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The \nnoncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. The share of earnings \nattributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these \namounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year\u2019s presentation. \nWe have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of \nthree months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various \nfinancial institutions.\n(b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt \ninvestments. Our available-for-sale debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, non-U.S. \ngovernment and agency, corporate debt, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. \nThese available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific \nidentification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are \nrecorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included as a \nseparate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as \ncurrent based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n(c) Equity Instruments   Our equity investments are accounted for as follows:\n\u2022\nMarketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value \nthrough income.\n\u2022\nNon-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at \ncost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of \nthese securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair \nvalue of these investments.\n\u2022\nEquity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee. \nThese investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee \nincome or loss.\n(d) Impairments of Investments   For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether \na credit loss exists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the \namortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the \nsecurity. If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by the \namount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors is \nrecognized in other comprehensive income (OCI).\nWe hold non-marketable equity and other investments (\u201cprivately held investments\u201d) which are included in other assets in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we \ndetermine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these \ncompanies.\n63",
  "(e) Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which \napproximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete \ninventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of \nthe inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, \nwhich is a component of cost of sales. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, \nand subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost \nbasis. In addition, we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract \nmanufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and \nobsolete inventory. \n(f) Allowance for Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Financing Receivables   We estimate our allowances for credit \nlosses using relevant available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and \nreasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit \nlosses. When assessing for credit losses, we determine collectibility by pooling our assets with similar characteristics.\nThe allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our internal \ncredit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality. Assets that \ndo not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. The allowances for credit losses are each measured by \nmultiplying the exposure probability of default, the probability the asset will default within a given time frame, by the loss \ngiven default rate, the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default, based on the pool of assets.\nProbability of default rates are published quarterly by third-party credit agencies. Adjustments to our internal credit risk ratings \nmay take into account including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the \ngeographic locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or \nwhen facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary.\n(g) Financing Receivables and Guarantees   We provide financing arrangements, including loan receivables and lease \nreceivables, for certain qualified end-user customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Loan receivables represent \nfinancing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services (including technical support and advanced \nservices), and also may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our \nproducts and services. Loan receivables have terms of one year to three years on average. Lease receivables represent sales-type \nleases resulting from the sale of Cisco\u2019s and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security \ninterest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average. \nOutstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We \ndo not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired and more than 120 days past due unless either the \nreceivable has not been collected due to administrative reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection. \nFinancing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management\u2019s opinion, a timely collection of the full \nprincipal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be \nrecognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer\u2019s \ndelinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period. \nWe facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, \ngenerally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer \nof our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and \nwe receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing",

The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and \nwe receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing \narrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of \nthese arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the \nchannel partners. Deferred revenue relating to these financing arrangements is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition \npolicies or for the fair value of the financing guarantees.\n(h) Leases   We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements \nwith certain suppliers and contract manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases \nhave the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. \nAs a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an \nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease. \nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease \npayments over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to \ndetermine the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our \nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n64",
  "variable lease payments can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain services where we have elected to \ncombine lease and non-lease components. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities, they are \nrecognized as variable lease expense in the period they are incurred.\nWe provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and \ndistributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. As a lessor, we determine if \nan arrangement is a lease at inception. We provide leasing arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers. Our \nlease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases. We allocate the consideration in a bundled contract with our customers \nbased on relative standalone selling prices of our lease and non-lease components. The residual value on our leased equipment \nis determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimates of the value of equipment, market factors and \nhistorical customer behavior. Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are \nexpensed in the period they occur. Our leases generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer to extend the lease \nunder mutually-agreed terms, return the leased equipment, or purchase the equipment for either the then-market value of the \nequipment or a pre-determined purchase price. If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of \ntermination date, the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full.\n(i) Depreciation and Amortization   Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization, \nwhenever applicable. Depreciation and amortization expenses for property and equipment were approximately $0.7 billion, $0.7 \nbillion, and $0.8 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the \nstraight-line method, generally over the following periods:\nAsset Category\nPeriod\nBuildings    ......................................................................................\n25 years\nBuilding improvements  ................................................................\nUp to 15 years\nLeasehold improvements    .............................................................\nShorter of remaining lease term or up to 15 years\nProduction, engineering, computer and other equipment and \nrelated software     ............................................................................\nUp to 5 years\nOperating lease assets     ..................................................................\nBased on lease term\nFurniture and fixtures   ...................................................................\n5 years\n(j) Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets, \nliabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D), based on their estimated fair \nvalues. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is \nrecorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for \nimpairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible \nasset and amortized over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are \nrecognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\n(k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets   Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter \nand, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down \nto fair value. Identifying a potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying \namount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. \nAmortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See \u201cLong-Lived Assets\u201d for our policy \nregarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives \nare assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be \nimpaired.\n(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes \nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of \nlong-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its",
  "impaired.\n(l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes \nin circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of \nlong-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its \neventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is \nbased on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are \nreported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. \n(m) Fair Value   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for \nassets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most \n65\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when \npricing the asset or liability. \nThe accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize \nthe use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of \nindependent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument\u2019s categorization \nwithin the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \nThe fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or \nliability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in \nmarkets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which \nsignificant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. We use inputs \nsuch as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted \nmarket prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant \nto the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques \nsuch as discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data.\n(n) Derivative Instruments   We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at \nfair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the \nresulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in \nthe period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a \nderivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and \nsubsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For a derivative instrument designated as a \nnet investment hedge of our foreign operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within \nAOCI together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operations. For derivative \ninstruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of \nchange. We record derivative instruments in the statements of cash flows to operating, investing, or financing activities \nconsistent with the cash flows of the hedged item.\nHedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contracts used as cash flow hedges is assessed by comparing the change in \nthe fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge \neffectiveness for equity forward contracts and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contracts is assessed by \ncomparing changes in fair value due to changes in spot rates for both the derivative and the hedged item. For foreign exchange \noption contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument\u2019s entire change in fair value. Hedge \neffectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair \nvalue of the hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. \n(o) Foreign Currency Translation   Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, \nwhere that local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet \ndate, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of AOCI. Income and expense \naccounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in other income \n(loss), net.\n(p) Concentrations of Risk   Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions.

Deposits held with \nbanks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon \ndemand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to \nmitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these \ncounterparties.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, do not \nrequire collateral from our customers. We receive certain of our components from sole suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a \nlimited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products. The inability of a \ncontract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially impact future operating results.\n66\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "(q) Revenue Recognition   We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and \nservices which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may \ncontain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can \nbenefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our \ncommitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. \nWe classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses \nrepresent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver \nhardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to \nour term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers. \nRevenue from subscription offers includes revenue recognized over time as well as upfront.\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that \nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the \ncustomer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software is \navailable for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can \nalso occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. Our \nhardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon \ntransfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized \nupfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as \nservices and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of \nthe software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue \nrecognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration \nfrom shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nAn allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future \nsales returns as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023 was $37 million and $39 million, respectively, and was recorded as a \nreduction of our accounts receivable and revenue.\nSignificant Judgments \nRevenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be \nentitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct \nperformance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price \nof a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where \nSSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable \ninputs. \nWe assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in \nidentifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration \nwhen determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and \nvarious rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and \ncustomers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying \nthe expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes \navailable. We also consider the customers\u2019 right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nWe assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can \ndownload throughout the contract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish \nover a relatively short time period. These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased",

We also consider the customers\u2019 right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nWe assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can \ndownload throughout the contract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish \nover a relatively short time period. These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased \nsecurity software licenses and are required to maintain the security license\u2019s utility as the risks and threats in the environment \nare rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single \nperformance obligation satisfied over the contract term.\n(r) Advertising Costs   We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs included within sales and marketing \nexpenses were approximately $210 million, $205 million, and $219 million for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n(s) Share-Based Compensation Expense   We measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share-based awards \nmade to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted \nstock units (PRSUs), and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase \nRights) based on estimated fair values. Share-based compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures as they occur.\n67\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "(t) Software Development Costs   Software development costs, including costs to develop software sold, leased, or otherwise \nmarketed, that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized. Costs incurred during \nthe application development stage for internal-use software and cloud-based applications are capitalized. Such software \ndevelopment costs capitalized during the periods presented were not material.\n(u) Income Taxes   Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their \nreported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not \nbe realized.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. \nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is \nmore likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if \nany. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon \nsettlement. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt) \nof cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income \ntaxes.\n(v) Computation of Net Income per Share   Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of \ncommon shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of \ncommon shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding includes the \ndilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity \nawards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury \nstock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future \nservice that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.\n(w) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities   Our approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest \nentities focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable \ninterest entity\u2019s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits \nfrom the variable interest entity. Should we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, \nliabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity will be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(x) Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles \ngenerally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported \nin the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for the following, among others:\n\u25aa\nRevenue recognition\n\u25aa\nAllowances for accounts receivable, sales returns, and financing receivables\n\u25aa\nInventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers\n\u25aa\nLoss contingencies and product warranties\n\u25aa\nFair value measurements\n\u25aa\nValuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets\n\u25aa\nIncome taxes\nThe actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.\n(y) Recent Accounting Standards or Updates Not Yet Effective as of Fiscal Year End\nSegment Reporting     In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard \nupdate that expands the disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures around \nsignificant segment expenses. The accounting standard update will be effective for our fiscal 2025 Form 10-K on a \nretrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update \non our segment disclosures. \nImprovements on Income Tax Disclosures     In December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update expanding the \nrequirements for disclosure of disaggregated information about the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The \naccounting standard update will be effective for our fiscal 2026 Form 10-K. We are currently evaluating the impact of this \naccounting standard update on our income tax disclosures.\n68\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.",

  "3.\nRevenue\n(a) Disaggregation of Revenue\nWe disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue \nand cash flows for our various offerings. The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market \nstrategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category.

  "(c) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\nWe capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated \nrevenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and \nrenewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to \nthe period of benefit. Capitalized contract acquisition costs were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, \n2023, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these \ncosts was $742 million, $723 million, and $679 million for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and was included in sales \nand marketing expenses.\n4.\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Splunk Inc.\nOn March 18, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Splunk Inc.

  "We incurred $82 million of transaction costs related to the Splunk acquisition and these costs were expensed as incurred in \ngeneral and administrative expenses (\u201cG&A\u201d) expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We incurred $79 million \nof these transaction costs in fiscal 2024.\nIn connection with the Splunk acquisition, we assumed $3.1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes consisting of Splunk's \n1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025, 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 and 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes \ndue 2027 (collectively, the \u201cSplunk Convertible Notes\u201d). The Splunk Convertible Notes had an aggregate fair value of \n$3.3 billion as of the acquisition date. The Splunk Convertible Notes are convertible and may be settled into cash based on a \ndefined conversion ratio for each note. On the date of the acquisition, we notified holders of their right to convert their notes. In \naddition, we assumed Splunk\u2019s capped call contracts which were intended to reduce potential dilution or offset any cash \npayments. The capped calls were settled in full in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which resulted in receipt of aggregate cash \nproceeds of $202 million, and were included in other current assets in total purchase consideration noted above. As of July 27, \n2024, we have settled $3.1 billion of the Splunk Convertible Notes, net of capped calls.\nThe goodwill generated from Splunk is primarily related to expected synergies. Goodwill is not deductible for income tax \npurposes.\nPurchased Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents as of the acquisition date details of the purchased intangible assets acquired (in millions, except \nyears):\nWeighted-\nAverage Useful \nLife (in Years)\nAmount\nCustomer related     ............................................................................................................................\n9.1\n$ \n6,140 \nTechnology   .....................................................................................................................................\n6.0\n3,900 \nTrade name     .....................................................................................................................................\n12.0\n510 \nTotal\n$ \n10,550 \nThe majority of customer-related intangible assets relates to customer contracts and related relationships. The customer \ncontracts and related relationships intangible asset represents the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from \nsales of products to existing customers of Splunk. The asset was valued using the with-and-without method under the income \napproach. In the with-and-without method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash \nflows with and without the existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. The \npresent value of projected future cash flows included significant judgment and assumptions regarding projected future revenues, \nprojected expenses, attrition rates, the revenue build up period, and the discount rate.\nTechnology represents the preliminary estimated fair value of Splunk\u2019s security and observability technologies. The technology \nintangible asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the \npresent value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the technology asset less charges representing the \ncontribution of other assets to those cash flows. The present value of projected future cash flows included significant judgment \nand assumptions regarding projected future revenues, projected expenses, the technology obsolescence rate, and the discount \nrate.\nTrade name represents the preliminary estimated fair value of the Splunk trade name. The fair value was determined by \napplying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to \nforecasted revenue under the trade name.\nCompensation Expense Related to Splunk\nIn connection with the Splunk acquisition, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the continued \nemployment with Cisco of certain Splunk employees. For fiscal 2024, the compensation expense was $413 million. As of \nJuly 27, 2024, we estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to $1.1 billion may be required to be recognized \npursuant to acquisition-related agreements.\n72\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",

The Fiscal 2025 Plan is expected to impact approximately \n7% of our global workforce, with estimated pre-tax charges of up to $1 billion consisting of severance and other one-time \ntermination benefits, and other costs. We expect this plan to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2025.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we initiated a restructuring plan (the \u201cFiscal 2024 Plan\u201d), in order to realign the organization \nand enable further investment in key priority areas, of which approximately 5% of our global workforce would be impacted. In \nconnection with the Fiscal 2024 Plan, we incurred charges of $654 million for fiscal 2024 and the plan is substantially \ncomplete. The aggregate pretax charges related to this plan were primarily cash-based and consist of severance and other one-\ntime termination benefits and other costs.\nWe initiated a restructuring plan in fiscal 2023 (the \u201cFiscal 2023 Plan\u201d), which was completed in fiscal 2024.

Our net adjustments to non-marketable equity securities measured using the \nmeasurement alternative still held was a net loss of $165 million and $8 million for fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We held \nequity interests in certain private equity funds of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, \nrespectively, which are accounted for under the NAV practical expedient.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. \nThese privately held companies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest \nentity models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and our customer financings, \nand have determined that as of July 27, 2024, there were no additional significant variable interest or voting interest entities \nrequired to be consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of July 27, 2024, the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.8 billion. Of the total carrying \nvalue of our investments in privately held companies as of July 27, 2024, $0.9 billion of such investments are considered to be \nin variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. We have total funding commitments of $0.2 billion related to privately \nheld investments. The carrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments, collectively, represent our \nmaximum exposure related to privately held investments. \n84\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",

These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on \nvaluation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, \nrights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\nThe fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to \nthe use of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation. Significant unobservable inputs that were used included expected \nrevenues and net income related to the assets and the expected life of the assets. The difference between the estimated fair value \nand the carrying value of the assets was recorded as an impairment charge, which was included in product cost of sales and \noperating expenses as applicable.

The estimated fair value of our long-term loan receivables approximates their carrying value. We use \nunobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables, and \ntherefore they are categorized as Level 3.\nAs of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the \nshort maturities. As of July 27, 2024, the fair value of our senior notes was $20.4 billion, with a carrying amount of $20.1 \nbillion. This compares to a fair value of $8.7 billion and a carrying amount of $8.4 billion as of July 29, 2023.

This swap converts the fixed interest rate of the fixed-rate note to a \nfloating interest rate based on Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The gain and loss related to the change in the fair \nvalue of the interest rate swap substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that \nis attributable to the change in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13.\nInterest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable \nby us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium.

Derivative Instruments \n(a) Summary of Derivative Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price \nrisks. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes \nin foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the \ncounterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties \nto major financial institutions and requiring collateral in certain cases. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one \ncounterparty resulting from credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by \ncounterparties.\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments and the line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to which they were \nrecorded are summarized as follows (in millions):\n \nDERIVATIVE ASSETS\nDERIVATIVE LIABILITIES\n \nBalance Sheet Line Item\nJuly 27, \n2024\nJuly 29, \n2023\nBalance Sheet Line Item\nJuly 27, \n2024\nJuly 29, \n2023\nDerivatives designated as hedging \ninstruments:\nForeign currency derivatives    ...............

  "(b) Offsetting of Derivative Instruments\nWe present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and \nother similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are \ndesigned to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty.\nTo further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby \ncash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these \ncollateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral provided for was $11 million and $40 million as of July 27, 2024 and \nJuly 29, 2023, respectively.\n(c) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency \nexchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not \nenter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\nWe hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with \ncurrency options and forward contracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, \ngenerally have maturities of less than 24 months. The derivative instrument\u2019s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of \naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure \naffects earnings.\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on \nassets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives are \nnot designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and \nsubstantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in \ncurrencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity.\nWe hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency \nfluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to \nsix months.\n(d) Interest Rate Risk\nWe hold an interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge related to a fixed-rate senior note that is due in fiscal 2025. \nUnder the interest rate swap, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on SOFR plus a fixed \nnumber of basis points. The effect of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate of the senior fixed-rate note to a floating \ninterest rate based on SOFR. The gain and loss related to the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is included in \ninterest expense and substantially offsets the change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt attributable to \nthe change in market interest rates. \n(e) Equity Price Risk \nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also \nhold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment \ntypes are included in other income (loss), net. \nWe are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees \nand directors. Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically \nhedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense. \n90\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "14. Commitments and Contingencies \n(a) Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers \nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services \nfor our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate \ncomponent supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory \nbased upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A significant portion of our reported \npurchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. Certain \nof these inventory purchase commitments are directly with suppliers, and relate to fixed-dollar commitments to secure supply \nand pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to \ncancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. \nThe following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions):\nCommitments by Period\nJuly 27,\n2024\nJuly 29,\n2023\nLess than 1 year    .................................................................................................................. $ \n3,952 $ \n5,270 \n1 to 3 years    ..........................................................................................................................  \n1,085  \n1,783 \n3 to 5 years    ..........................................................................................................................  \n121  \n200 \nTotal    ............................................................................................................................. $ \n5,158 $ \n7,253 \nWe record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future \ndemand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, the \nliability for these purchase commitments was $498 million and $529 million, respectively, and was included in other current \nliabilities.\n(b) Other Commitments\nWe have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our privately held investments. The funding commitments were \n$0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n(c) Product Warranties\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the product warranty liability (in millions):\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nBalance at beginning of fiscal year ................................................... $ \n329 $ \n333 $ \n336 \nProvisions for warranties issued     .......................................................  \n425  \n386  \n415 \nAdjustments for pre-existing warranties      ...........................................  \n22  \n18  \n3 \nSettlements      .......................................................................................  \n(414)  \n(408)  \n(421) \nBalance at end of fiscal year     ............................................................. $ \n362 $ \n329 $ \n333 \nWe accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for technical \nsupport staff, and associated overhead. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to \nfive years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty.\n(d) Financing and Other Guarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to \nchannel partners customers. Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods \npresented.\nChannel Partner Financing Guarantees   We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, \nconsisting of revolving short-term financing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. These financing \narrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of \nthese arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $27.1 billion, $32.1 billion, and $27.9 billion in fiscal 2024, \n2023, and 2022, respectively. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.7 \nbillion as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively.\n91\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "Financing Guarantee Summary   The aggregate amounts of channel partner financing guarantees outstanding at July 27, 2024 \nand July 29, 2023, representing the total maximum potential future payments under financing arrangements with third parties \nalong with the related deferred revenue, are summarized in the following table (in millions):\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nMaximum potential future payments       .................................................................................. $ \n127 $ \n159 \nDeferred revenue   .................................................................................................................  \n(13)  \n(34) \nTotal   ...................................................................................................................... $ \n114 $ \n125 \n(e) Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we have indemnification obligations to other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties \nto other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach \nof representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These \nagreements may limit the time or circumstances within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the \nclaim.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount for claims made under the indemnification obligations due to \nuncertainties in the litigation process, coordination with and contributions by other parties and the defendants in these types of \ncases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case and agreement. Historically, indemnity payments \nmade by us have not had a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated \nBylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. \n(f)\nLegal Proceedings\nBrazil    Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a \nBrazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged \nimproper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our \nBrazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In \naddition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of \nSao Paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. \nThe asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the \ntax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state \nand federal tax authorities aggregate to $143 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $830 million for interest, \nand $325 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 27, 2024. \nWe have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are \nwithout merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due \nto the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint \nliability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary \nand are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. \nCentripetal     On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (\u201cCentripetal\u201d) asserted patent infringement claims against us \nin the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that several of our products and services infringe eleven \nCentripetal U.S. patents. After two bench trials and various administrative actions and appeals, we have been found either to not \nhave infringed any of the patents or the patents have been invalidated. Centripetal has appealed one of the invalidity decisions \nand it has also appealed the non-infringement judgment of the District Court and both of those proceedings are ongoing.\nBetween April 2020 and February 2022, Centripetal also filed complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany \n(\u201cGerman Court\u201d), asserting a total of five patents and one utility model. Centripetal sought damages and injunctive relief in all \ncases. In various proceedings in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have been found to have not infringed three patents, one patent was",
  "and it has also appealed the non-infringement judgment of the District Court and both of those proceedings are ongoing.\nBetween April 2020 and February 2022, Centripetal also filed complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany \n(\u201cGerman Court\u201d), asserting a total of five patents and one utility model. Centripetal sought damages and injunctive relief in all \ncases. In various proceedings in 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have been found to have not infringed three patents, one patent was \ninvalidated, the utility model was invalidated, and the infringement action on the final patent is stayed due to an invalidity \naction heard on June 6, 2024 in the Federal Patent Court, in which all claims, aside from one auxiliary claim, were found \ninvalid, for which we are awaiting the entry of judgment from the Federal Patent Court. Centripetal\u2019s appeals of two of the non-\ninfringement findings remain pending and, on March 27, 2024, the Court of Appeals rejected Centripetal\u2019s appeal of the third \nnon-infringement finding.\n92\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "On July 10, 2023, Centripetal filed a complaint in the Paris Judiciary Court asserting the French counterpart of a European \nPatent. Centripetal seeks damages and injunctive relief in the case. Centripetal previously asserted the German counterpart of \nthe same European Patent in Germany and the German Court rejected Centripetal\u2019s complaint finding no infringement. We \nhave filed our response and defenses to the complaint and we anticipate that in October 2024, the Court will set a schedule for \nthe remainder of the proceedings.\nDue to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, we are unable to reasonably estimate the \nultimate outcome of the litigations at this time. If we do not prevail in these litigations, we believe that any damages ultimately \nassessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRamot     On June 12, 2019 and on February 26, 2021, Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (\u201cRamot\u201d) asserted patent \ninfringement claims against Cisco and Acacia in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (\u201cE.D. Tex.\u201d) and in \nthe District of Delaware (\u201cD. Del.\u201d), respectively. Ramot is seeking damages, including enhanced damages, and a royalty on \nfuture sales. Ramot alleges that certain optical transceiver modules and line cards infringe three patents. We challenged the \nvalidity of the patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d) and the pending District Court cases have been stayed. \nOn September 28, 2021 and May 24, 2022, Cisco and Acacia filed two declaratory judgment actions of noninfringement against \nRamot in D. Del on other Ramot patents and those proceedings are ongoing. \nWhile we believe that we have strong non-infringement and invalidity arguments in these litigations, and that Ramot\u2019s damages \ntheories in such cases are not supported by prevailing law, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these \nlitigations at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation processes. If we do not prevail in court in these litigations, we believe \nany damages ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEgenera     On August 8, 2016, Egenera, Inc. (\u201cEgenera\u201d) asserted infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Massachusetts, alleging that Cisco\u2019s Unified Computing System Manager infringes three patents. Egenera sought \ndamages, including enhanced damages, and an injunction. Two of the asserted patents were dismissed, leaving Egenera\u2019s \ninfringement claim based on one asserted patent. On March 25, 2022, the PTO preliminarily found all of the asserted claims of \nthe remaining patent unpatentable in ex parte reexamination proceedings. On August 15, 2022, after a jury trial for the \nremaining patent, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Cisco. The District Court denied Egenera\u2019s post-trial motions, and \nEgenera filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit on January 13, 2023, the appeal is fully briefed and we are awaiting a hearing \ndate from the Federal Circuit.\nIn addition to the above matters, we are subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course \nof business, including intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do \nnot believe that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFor additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u2014We may be found to \ninfringe on intellectual property rights of others\u201d herein.  \n15. Stockholders\u2019 Equity \n(a) Stock Repurchase Program\nIn September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 27, 2024, the remaining \nauthorized amount for stock repurchases under this program was approximately $5.2 billion with no termination date. \nOur stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows \n(in millions, except per-share amounts):\nYears Ended\nShares\nWeighted-Average \nPrice per Share\nAmount\nJuly 27, 2024     .................................................................................................\n \n117 $ \n49.45 $ \n5,764 \nJuly 29, 2023     ..................................................................................................\n \n88 $ \n48.49 $ \n4,271 \nJuly 30, 2022     ..................................................................................................\n \n146 $ \n52.82 $ \n7,734 \nThere were $25 million, $48 million and $70 million in stock repurchases that were pending settlement as of July 27, 2024, \nJuly 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022, respectively.\nThe purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to stockholders\u2019 equity. \n93\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
  "We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to \naccumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.\n(b) Dividends Declared\nOn August 14, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per common share to be paid on October 23, \n2024, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 2, 2024. Future dividends will be subject to the \napproval of our Board of Directors.\n(c) Preferred Stock\nUnder the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue \npreferred stock in one or more series and, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix by resolution the designation, \npowers (including voting powers (if any)), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights, if any, of such \nseries, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. As of July 27, 2024, we have not \nissued any shares of preferred stock.\n16. Employee Benefit Plans  \n(a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans\nWe have one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2005 Plan\u201d). In addition, we have, in connection with \nour acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired \ncompanies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof. Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their \nlong-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with us. The number and frequency of share-based \nawards are based on competitive practices, our operating results, government regulations, and other factors.\nThe 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the \nvesting of which may be time-based or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions. Time-based \nand performance-based RSUs generally vest over three years with certain awards containing retirement eligible provisions. \nEmployees (including employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and \nnon-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by our Board of \nDirectors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2030 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or \nextended by our stockholders prior to or on such date.\nUnder the 2005 Plan\u2019s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) \nstock options and SARs and (ii) \u201cfull value\u201d awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant \nto stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the \n2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, \n1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or \nterminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of \nadditional shares, if any, that counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of \nthe application of the share ratio described above, will become available again for issuance under the 2005 Plan. As of July 27, \n2024, 156 million shares were authorized for future grant under the 2005 Plan.\n(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering \nperiod, which consists of four consecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of \nour stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of \neach 6-month purchase period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, \n2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to \nexercised purchase rights. We issued 20 million, 19 million, and 18 million shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in \nfiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of July 27, 2024, 68 million shares were available for issuance under the \nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan.\n94\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",

  "(e) Valuation of Employee Share-Based Awards\nTime-based restricted stock units and PRSUs that are based on our financial performance metrics or non-financial operating \ngoals are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the present value of expected \ndividends. Starting in fiscal 2023, for PRSUs granted, we included a relative total shareholder return (TSR) modifier to \ndetermine the number of shares earned at the end of the performance period. The TSR modifier is determined using a Monte \nCarlo simulation model. For PRSUs granted in fiscal 2022, on the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the TSR \ncomponent of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are \ncontingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics, our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement \nof financial and non-financial operating goals. \nThe assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows:\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\nYears Ended\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nNumber of shares granted (in millions)   ...............................................  \n60 \n \n70 \n \n50 \nGrant date fair value per share  ............................................................. $ \n48.71 \n$ \n42.13 \n$ \n49.68 \nWeighted-average assumptions/inputs:\n   Expected dividend yield   ...................................................................\n 3.0%\n 3.4%\n 2.9%\n   Range of risk-free interest rates     ........................................................\n4.2% \u2013 5.6%\n3.7% \u2013 5.7%\n0.0% \u2013 3.0%\nPERFORMANCE BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS\nYears Ended\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nNumber of shares granted (in millions)   ...............................................  \n3  \n2  \n2 \nGrant date fair value per share  ............................................................. $ \n59.31 $ \n40.44 $ \n59.64 \nWeighted-average assumptions/inputs:\n   Expected dividend yield   ...................................................................\nN/A\nN/A\n 0.4%\n   Range of risk-free interest rates     ........................................................\nN/A\nN/A\n0.0% \u2013 0.7%\nThe assumptions for the valuation of employee stock purchase rights are summarized as follows:\n \nEMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS\nYears Ended\nJuly 27, 2024\nJuly 29, 2023\nJuly 30, 2022\nWeighted-average assumptions:\n   Expected volatility    ............................................................................\n 28.3 %\n 28.7 %\n 27.9 %\n   Risk-free interest rate      .......................................................................\n 2.9 %\n 2.8 %\n 0.1 %\n   Expected dividend   ............................................................................\n 3.5 %\n 3.6 %\n 3.2 %\n   Expected life (in years)    .....................................................................\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\nWeighted-average estimated grant date fair value per share    ............... $ \n11.59 \n$ \n12.40 \n$ \n12.90 \nThe valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during \nthe respective fiscal years.\nWe used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock \npurchase rights) on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model.

  "(f)\nEmployee 401(k) Plans\nWe sponsor the Cisco Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) to provide retirement benefits for our employees. As allowed \nunder Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax \ncontributions for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the \nPlan on a pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual \namount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the \nfirst 4.5% of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may \nallocate to each participant\u2019s account will not exceed $15,525 for the 2024 calendar year due to the $345,000 annual limit on \neligible earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching \ncontributions to the Plan totaled $358 million, $342 million, and $306 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nThe Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up \ncontributions (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser of 75% of their annual eligible earnings or the limit set forth in the \nInternal Revenue Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for \ndiscretionary profit-sharing contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated \namong eligible participants in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. There were no discretionary \nprofit-sharing contributions made in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nWe also sponsor other 401(k) plans as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Our contributions to these plans were not \nmaterial to Cisco on either an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented.\n(g) Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the \u201cDeferred Compensation Plan\u201d), a nonqualified deferred \ncompensation plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan \nis limited to a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded and \nunsecured deferred compensation arrangement, a participant may elect to defer base salary, bonus, and/or commissions, \npursuant to such rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in \nthe plan. We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan. \nA matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code limit for qualified \nplans for calendar year 2024 that is deferred by participants under the Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on \neligible compensation) will be made to eligible participants\u2019 accounts at the end of calendar year 2024. The total deferred \ncompensation liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan, together with deferred compensation plans assumed from \nacquired companies, was approximately $1.1 billion and $910 million as of July 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, and \nwas recorded primarily in other long-term liabilities. \n97\nCISCO SYSTEMS, INC.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)",
