The document chunk references are numerical and do not contain explicit data on net income per share by class or year, and the search results discuss overall revenues and net income but not the per share breakdowns requested. Thus, the answer is mostly factually incorrect and incomplete. The answer is clearly presented but based on unsupported data.\n"
