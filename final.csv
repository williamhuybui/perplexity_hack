"How does Cisco Systems, Inc. plan to support customers in modernizing their infrastructure during fiscal year 2024, particularly in terms of automation and real-time network management?","Cisco can help customers connect, protect and draw actionable insights from their technology. We do this in service of 
delivering the digital resilience our customers need for today’s complex and unpredictable world.
Customer Priorities
Modernize Infrastructure
In an increasingly digital and connected world, where each new connection to the Internet puts more demand on the network, 
our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure, including through automation to manage and 
monitor each connection in real time.
We continue to transform our enterprise networking portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form an integrated 
architecture. Our vision is to build a unified management platform experience for on-premise and cloud operating models, that 
simplifies and helps secure networking for customers at scale.
Our Observability offerings collect and process daily measurements from customers’ owned and unowned networks, providing 
automated insights, proactive recommendations, and closed-loop operations tailored to customers to enable them to reduce 
mean time to resolution of issues and improve IT productivity and user experience.
For the data center, our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless 
of where applications or data reside. We continue to make significant investments in the development of software, silicon and 
optics, which we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future.
As part of modernizing their infrastructure, customers of every size are also looking for solutions to help them communicate 
more effectively with their customers and to connect their employees more efficiently for productivity. Our collaboration 
portfolio, which includes interoperable devices and our cloud contact center, provides those solutions, and serves as a key 
component of smart buildings, powered over ethernet, that we believe will define the workplaces of the future.
Improve Cybersecurity
With the rapid growth in modern applications, hyper-distributed architecture and increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, 
customers see cybersecurity as a top priority. Our differentiated security strategy is based on three pillars: moving from point 
solutions to a platform comprehensively integrated with the infrastructure; infusing security into the fabric of the network; and 
harnessing the depth and breadth of telemetry data from Cisco and with our acquisition of Splunk Inc. (“Splunk”) to prevent, 
detect, and respond to sophisticated attacks.
Harness the Power of AI and Data
AI represents a generational shift in technology and is driving an order of magnitude higher requirement for network 
connectivity. We provide network infrastructure to power AI training and inference workloads for both webscalers and 
enterprises. We help to scale our customers’ network infrastructure with high-density routers and switches, improved network 
management, and high-performance optics. We are reinventing data center operations for our customers by simplifying the 
configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of fabrics, compute, networking and storage.
We can help give customers visibility across the network, security solutions, applications and their own business data. With this 
breadth and scale of data, we can help deliver differentiated insights and context to customers, leading them to more informed 
proactive decisions and better business results.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our Strategy and Priorities, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor 
entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, 
and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and 
market share may suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
2","Cisco Systems, Inc. is supporting customers in modernizing their infrastructure during fiscal year 2024 by focusing on three core customer priorities: building modern and resilient infrastructure, protecting against cyber threats, and harnessing the power of AI and data. 

To address automation and real-time network management specifically, Cisco is delivering solutions that enable end-to-end infrastructure that is self-monitoring, self-analyzing, and self-optimizing[5]. Their Unified Computing portfolio is designed to increase performance, reduce total cost of ownership (TCO), and simplify management by supporting modern automation, orchestration, management, and analytics tools[5]. This approach allows customers to securely and efficiently provision infrastructure resources while gaining actionable insights from their technology environments.

Cisco’s ongoing innovation is delivered through a combination of hardware, software, and subscription-based services, aligning with flexible consumption models that customers increasingly demand. By providing visibility into data across networks, connected devices, and applications, Cisco enables real-time insights and context for customers, supporting both on-premise and cloud infrastructure. 

Additionally, Cisco is investing in AI-ready data center infrastructure and next-generation modular compute systems, such as the UCS X-Series, to offer more flexibility and choice for customers looking to modernize their compute environments[1][3]. These investments are part of a broader strategy to help customers achieve digital resilience and adapt to the complex, unpredictable demands of today’s technology landscape.",5,5,5,"The answer accurately reflects the document chunk, addressing all key points about automation, real-time management, and Cisco’s investments in AI and infrastructure, while remaining clear and complete."
"What provisions in Netflix, Inc.'s charter documents and Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders might consider favorable as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024?","Table of Contents
Risks Related to Our Stock Ownership
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable, although we
have announced plans to modify some of these provisions over time.
Our charter documents in their current form may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable because
they:
•
authorize our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;
•
provide for a classified board of directors until our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2025;
•
prohibit our stockholders from acting by written consent; and
•
establish advance notice requirements for proposing matters to be approved by stockholders at stockholder meetings.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a
business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board
of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.
In addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated
Executive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.
Our stock price is volatile.
The price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including
the following, some of which are beyond our control:
•
variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by
operating activities and free cash flow;
•
variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;
•
announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;
•
competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;
•
market volatility in general;
•
the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;
•
the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;
•
the operating results of our competitors; and
•
other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.
As a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.
Following certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such
litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.
Preparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.
Given the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income
and other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the
ad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the
lack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts
or investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization
pattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various
factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the
14","As of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, provisions in Netflix, Inc.'s charter documents and Delaware law that could discourage a takeover that stockholders might consider favorable include:

1. **Authorization to Issue Preferred Stock**: Netflix's board of directors can issue up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock without stockholder approval. This can be used to dilute the voting power of common stockholders or to create a class of stock with superior voting rights, potentially discouraging a takeover[1][5].

2. **Classified Board of Directors**: Until the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2025, Netflix's board is classified, meaning directors serve staggered terms. This structure can make it more difficult for an acquirer to gain control of the board quickly[5].

3. **Prohibition on Written Consent**: Stockholders are prohibited from acting by written consent, which can limit their ability to quickly respond to or initiate corporate actions without calling a meeting[5].

4. **Advance Notice Requirements**: Stockholders must provide advance notice for proposing matters to be approved at stockholder meetings, which can delay or complicate the process of initiating a takeover[5].

5. **Delaware Anti-Takeover Provisions**: As a Delaware corporation, Netflix is subject to Delaware law, which includes provisions that can discourage takeovers. For example, a corporation cannot engage in a business combination with a holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or the board of directors has approved the transaction[5].

6. **Retention Payments**: A merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees, increasing the cost of such a transaction[5].",5,5,5,"The answer accurately and completely lists all relevant provisions and state law considerations mentioned in the document chunk, presenting them clearly and precisely."

Meta reported a total revenue of $164.50 billion for the full year 2024, which represents a 22% increase from the previous year[3][5]. The company's revenue growth was driven by various factors, including increased ad impressions and higher average prices per ad[3]. However, the specific impact of foreign exchange effects on these metrics is not detailed in the available search results.

and APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute 
provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and 
accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.
Seasonality
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and 
automotive. Our desktop gaming products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. Historical 
seasonality trends may not repeat.
Manufacturing 
We utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for all 
phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the expertise 
of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as 
fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the 
significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly 
procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of 
components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the production of our products. 
As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods 
of growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical 
lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.
We have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term","NVIDIA Corporation leverages its intellectual property and GPU-based hardware solutions to help automotive partners, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups address the complex challenges of autonomous driving through a comprehensive, end-to-end AI computing platform and ecosystem.

**Key elements of NVIDIA's approach include:**

- **Three-Computer Solution for Autonomous Vehicles:** NVIDIA provides a unified AI development solution consisting of three main computing platforms. AI models are trained on the NVIDIA DGX™ platform, a high-performance AI training compute system designed to handle the massive datasets and complex scenarios required for autonomous driving development. This training enables the creation of sophisticated AI models capable of tackling complex driving situations[1][2].

- **Simulation and Validation with Omniverse and Cosmos:** NVIDIA Omniverse™ and Cosmos™ platforms simulate diverse, physically accurate environments to test and validate autonomous vehicle (AV) systems. These tools allow developers to build digital twins from real-world sensor data, model physics and behavior, and generate varied sensor data under different conditions such as weather, lighting, and geography. This simulation capability accelerates development and improves safety by enabling extensive testing before deployment[1][2].

- **In-Vehicle Real-Time Computing with DRIVE AGX:** The NVIDIA DRIVE AGX™ platform is a sensor-integrated reference system that streamlines prototyping, simulation, and validation for autonomous systems. Powered by the safety-certified DriveOS™, DRIVE AGX delivers high compute performance to process data from cameras, radar, and lidar sensors in real time, enabling safe and reliable autonomous driving decisions on the road[1][2].

- **Safety-First Approach with NVIDIA Halos:** NVIDIA extends its safety-first philosophy across the entire AV development lifecycle—from simulation and training to deployment—through NVIDIA Halos, which provides guardrails and standards to ensure robust safety measures are integrated throughout the process[1][2].

- **Unified AI Development Ecosystem:** By combining best-in-class software, infrastructure, and expertise, NVIDIA offers a scalable and efficient platform that supports continuous innovation. This ecosystem enables automotive partners, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups to train, test, and deploy autonomous driving systems more effectively, reducing bottlenecks and accelerating time to market[1][2].

This integrated approach, leveraging NVIDIA's intellectual property in GPU-accelerated computing, AI software, and simulation technologies, empowers the automotive ecosystem to address the multifaceted challenges of autonomous driving in fiscal year 2024 by providing scalable, high-performance, and safety-certified solutions tailored for real-world deployment. 

Thus, NVIDIA's platform not only accelerates AI model training and validation but also ensures real-time, safe decision-making in vehicles, helping partners navigate the complexity of autonomous vehicle development efficiently and reliably[1][2].",2,1,4,"The model answer includes extensive details about NVIDIA's autonomous vehicle platforms and software ecosystem (DGX, Omniverse, DRIVE AGX, Halos) that are not present in the provided document chunk, which only broadly states that NVIDIA provides GPU-based hardware and licenses IP to automotive partners and tier-1 suppliers to solve complex autonomous driving challenges. The detailed references to specific products, simulation tools, safety frameworks, and ecosystem support are unsupported by the chunk. Therefore, the answer contains major factual inaccuracies relative to the source and misses the key insight from the chunk about IP licensing and collaboration.

"What criteria did the auditors use to evaluate Alphabet Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024?","REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Alphabet Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Alphabet Inc. (the Company) maintained, 
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO 
criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 4, 2025 
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with 
the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal 
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was 
maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a 
material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on 
the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We 
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are 
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on 
the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may 
deteriorate.

51.","The auditors evaluated Alphabet Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria established in the **Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)**. This framework is widely recognized as the standard for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for U.S. public companies[2].

The COSO framework includes five components:  
1. **Control Environment**  
2. **Risk Assessment**  
3. **Control Activities**  
4. **Information and Communication**  
5. **Monitoring Activities**  

Each component is supported by principles that guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of internal controls. The auditors’ opinion was based on whether Alphabet’s internal controls met these COSO criteria in all material respects[2][5].

Additionally, the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards of the **Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)**, which require the auditors to obtain reasonable assurance about the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The audit process included understanding internal controls, assessing the risk of material weaknesses, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of controls based on the assessed risk[2].",5,5,5,"The answer accurately identifies the criteria used by the auditors, namely the COSO 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework, and clearly explains the five components of the COSO framework.

"How could changes to legal protections for content moderation and third-party content impact Reddit, Inc.'s potential liability and operational costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024?","Our current protections from liability for content moderation decisions and third-party content posted on our platform in the 
United States could decrease or change, potentially resulting in increased liability for content moderation decisions and third-
party content posted on our platform and higher litigation costs. 
We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-
imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside of the 
United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected 
under local laws than we are in the United States. Numerous countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin 
America are considering or have implemented legislation and regulations imposing potentially significant penalties, including 
fines, service throttling, access bans, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain 
processes. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the imposition 
of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure 
obligations. Content-related legislation and regulations also have required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to

34","Changes to legal protections for content moderation and third-party content could significantly impact Reddit, Inc.'s potential liability and operational costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. 

## Impact on Liability

- Reddit’s current content moderation relies on a multi-layered approach involving community moderators (""mods"") who enforce community-specific rules, alongside Reddit employees (""admins"") who enforce sitewide rules. This decentralized model helps manage content at scale but depends heavily on legal protections that shield platforms from liability for third-party content posted by users[2][3].

- If legal protections for content moderation or immunity for third-party content providers were weakened or removed, Reddit could face increased legal exposure. This would mean Reddit might be held liable for user-generated content that violates laws or regulations, increasing the risk of costly litigation or regulatory penalties[4].

- Such changes could also require Reddit to be more proactive and stringent in content review and removal to mitigate liability, potentially leading to more aggressive moderation policies and increased scrutiny of user content[4].

## Impact on Operational Costs

- Increased liability risks would likely drive up Reddit’s operational costs, as the company would need to invest more in content moderation infrastructure, including hiring more moderators, enhancing automated detection systems, and legal compliance measures[4].

- Reddit already invests in machine learning systems and a combination of automated and manual review to enforce content policies, as reflected in their transparency reports showing increased bans for policy violations[1]. Changes in legal protections could necessitate further scaling of these systems and processes, increasing hosting and operational expenses[4].

- Additionally, Reddit might face higher costs related to legal defenses, settlements, or compliance with new regulatory requirements, which could affect its financial condition and prospects[4].

## Summary

In summary, any changes that reduce legal protections for content moderation and third-party content providers could increase Reddit’s potential liability for user content and substantially raise operational costs related to content moderation and legal compliance during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. This would pose risks to Reddit’s business, results of operations, and financial condition[4].",4,4,5,"The model answer accurately captures the key risks Reddit faces if legal protections for content moderation and third-party content change, including increased liability and operational costs, consistent with the document chunk. It reasonably integrates Reddit's moderation approach and potential financial impacts. However, the answer infers some operational details and internal processes not explicitly stated in the chunk but supported by related context from the sources, and it does not explicitly mention geographic-specific risks or government-imposed remedies detailed in the chunk, hence slightly deducting completeness and factual exactness."
