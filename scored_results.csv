"What happens to the issuance of shares, cash, or other property for a ""specified employee"" of NVIDIA Corporation in fiscal year 2025 if their separation from service occurs?","For a ""specified employee"" of NVIDIA Corporation in fiscal year 2025, if their separation from service occurs, the issuance of shares, cash, or other property under certain equity awards (such as RSUs, PSUs, or market-based PSUs) is subject to special rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Specifically, if the award is considered deferred compensation under Section 409A and the employee is a ""specified employee"" at the time of separation from service, any issuance of shares, cash, or other property that would otherwise occur on the date of separation (or within the first six months thereafter as a result of the separation) will be delayed. Instead, the issuance will be made in a lump sum on the earlier of:

- **Six months and one day after the date of separation from service**
- **The date of the employee’s death**

This delay is only required if it is necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A[1].

This rule does not apply to all equity awards, but only to those that are classified as deferred compensation under Section 409A. For example, most RSUs and PSUs that vest upon separation may not be subject to this rule unless they have specific deferral features. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is generally not considered deferred compensation under Section 409A and thus is not subject to this delay[3].

**Summary Table**

| Award Type         | Subject to 6-Month Delay for Specified Employees? | Notes                                                                 |
|--------------------|:-------------------------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RSUs/PSUs (if 409A)| Yes                                               | Only if classified as deferred compensation under Section 409A        |
| ESPP               | No                                                | Not considered deferred compensation under Section 409A               |

**Key Point:**  
If the award is deferred compensation under Section 409A and the employee is a specified employee, issuance is delayed for six months after separation from service (or until death, if earlier), but only if necessary to avoid adverse tax consequences[1].","[Document(id='7d2a587c-e316-45e4-88ff-d055ba8e0d1b', metadata={'producer': 'EDGRpdf Service w/ EO.Pdf 22.0.40.0', 'creator': 'EDGAR Filing HTML Converter', 'creationdate': '2025-02-26T16:49:22-05:00', 'source': 'finance_data/nvidia.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/nvidia.pdf', 'total_pages': 130, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '0001045810-25-000023', 'author': 'EDGAR® Online LLC, a subsidiary of OTC Markets Group', 'subject': 'Form 10-K filed on 2025-02-26 for the period ending 2025-01-26', 'keywords': '0001045810-25-000023; ; 10-K', 'moddate': '2025-02-26T16:49:44-05:00', 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V2 R3 128-bit RC4', 'modDate': ""D:20250226164944-05'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20250226164922-05'00'"", 'page': 63}, page_content='Table of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nSubject to certain exceptions, RSUs vest generally over four years subject to continued service.

"What potential risks and challenges did Cisco Systems, Inc. identify in their 2024 fiscal year report concerning acquisitions, particularly regarding market position, supply chain dependencies, financial impacts, and retention of key stakeholders?","Cisco Systems, Inc. identified several potential risks and challenges related to acquisitions in their 2024 fiscal year report, particularly concerning market position, supply chain dependencies, financial impacts, and retention of key stakeholders:

## Market Position and Competitive Risks
- Acquisitions in high-technology sectors are inherently risky and may not succeed, potentially harming Cisco’s business, operating results, or financial condition.
- Failure to manage and integrate acquisitions successfully could materially harm Cisco’s business and operating results.
- Even if acquired companies have existing products, there is no assurance that product enhancements will be timely or that due diligence identified all issues.
- Entering new or developing markets through acquisitions exposes Cisco to additional competition and increased demands on service and support operations.
- Cisco faces competition from companies with potentially greater technical and engineering resources, which could impact its ability to compete effectively in new markets such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity[1].

## Supply Chain and Operational Integration Challenges
- Integration of acquired companies’ technology, systems, products, policies, processes, and operations can be difficult, especially in countries where Cisco does not currently operate.
- Challenges include lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with electronic data interchange, and training and change management needs.
- These integration challenges have impacted Cisco’s results of operations and may continue to do so.
- Cisco depends on non-U.S. operations of contract manufacturers, component suppliers, and distribution partners, making it vulnerable to political or economic changes in specific countries or regions[1].

## Financial Impacts and Liabilities
- Acquisitions may require issuing common stock, diluting current stockholders’ ownership.
- Cisco may use substantial cash resources or incur debt, increasing interest expenses, leverage, and debt service requirements.
- Acquisitions can lead to assuming liabilities, recording goodwill and intangible assets subject to impairment testing, and incurring amortization expenses.
- There is a risk of large write-offs, restructuring costs, tax expenses related to acquisitions, and potential impairment charges.
- Future acquisitions could result in dilutive equity issuances, contingent liabilities, incremental operating expenses, or goodwill impairment.
- Cisco’s effective tax rate could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions.
- The company may face legal proceedings or intellectual property litigation related to acquisitions[1][5].

## Retention of Key Stakeholders
- Retaining critical talent from acquired companies is a challenge; failure to do so could reduce anticipated benefits.
- Acquisitions may impair relationships with employees, vendors, and customers of both Cisco and the acquired companies.
- The announcement or pendency of acquisitions may disrupt the acquired company’s business operations and divert management’s attention.
- Regulatory approvals and conditions imposed by regulators could delay or reduce the value of acquisitions.
- Failure to obtain regulatory approval or close acquisitions could harm Cisco’s stock price, reputation, and business prospects[1][5].

In summary, Cisco’s 2024 fiscal year report highlights that acquisitions carry significant risks including integration difficulties, financial burdens, competitive pressures, supply chain vulnerabilities, and challenges in retaining key personnel and customer relationships. These factors could materially affect Cisco’s market position, financial health, and operational performance if not managed effectively.","[Document(id='4b77e6b3-8011-4a54-b415-447933c21a95', metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0; modified using iText 2.1.7 by 1T3XT', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-10-16T07:13:43+08:00', 'source': 'finance_data/cisco.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/cisco.pdf', 'total_pages': 132, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '2024-cisco-full-annual-report', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-10-18T13:52:34-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20241018135234-07'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20241016071343+08'00'"", 'page': 39}, page_content='Acquisitions have in the past and may in the future also cause us to:\n•\nIssue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership\n•\nUse a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt\n•\nSignificantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay \nfor an acquisition\n•\nAssume liabilities\n•\nRecord goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic \nimpairment charges\n•\nIncur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets\n•\nIncur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure\n•\nIncur large write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses\n•\nBecome subject to intellectual property or other litigation\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, \nand no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially harm our \nbusiness, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially \nharm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful \nintroduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and \nmarketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition \ndue diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax \nrate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks described with respect to new \nproduct development also apply to acquisitions.\nEntrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our \nservice and support operations.\nAs we focus on new market opportunities and key priority areas, such as AI, cloud, and cybersecurity, we compete with \ncompanies of all sizes. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, \nthan we do. Additionally, as customers complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, \nand financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, \nor financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and \nfinancing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject \nus to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer \nconfidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face \nincreased legal and regulatory requirements.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income.\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. \nSoftware typically contains bugs or other quality or reliability problems that can unexpectedly interfere with its intended \noperations or the intended operation of the systems in which our software is installed. There can be no assurance that our pre-\nshipment or pre-release testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that \ncould affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross \nmargins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of \ndefects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product \ninvolved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure of a product \nline, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, product \nreengineering expenses or legal liability, any of which could materially harm our revenue, margins, and net income.\nDue to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region \ncould harm our operating results and financial condition.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world.

If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions\nthat could help us achieve our other strategic objectives.

5. **Compliance with Ethical Requirements**: The auditors ensure compliance with relevant ethical requirements, including independence and communication of relationships that may affect independence[3].

## Approach to Subsidiaries Audited by Other Auditors

- The auditors consider reports from other auditors on separate financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled trusts to form their opinion on the consolidated financial statements[3].

## Legal and Regulatory Requirements

- The auditors ensure compliance with the Companies Act, 2013, and other applicable laws and regulations, including the maintenance of adequate accounting records and adherence to accounting standards[3].

Overall, the auditors' responsibilities are to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to express an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal financial controls.","[Document(id='190dedad-f02e-4a67-a7bb-65cd4a87edc2', metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 17.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 19.4 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2024-06-25T20:41:34+05:30', 'source': 'finance_data/oracle.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/oracle.pdf', 'total_pages': 196, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': 'Annual Report 2023-24', 'author': 'Oracle Financial Service Software Limited', 'subject': 'Annual Report', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-06-25T22:28:22+05:30', 'trapped': '', 'encryption': 'Standard V5 R6 256-bit AES', 'modDate': ""D:20240625222822+05'30'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20240625204134+05'30'"", 'page': 127}, page_content='Oracle Financial Services Software\u2009–\u2009Annual Report 2023-24\nand estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial \ncontrols, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the \npreparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material \nmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a \ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless \nmanagement either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable \nassurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect \na material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually \nor in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nstandalone financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout \nthe audit. We also:\n•\t\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, \ndesign and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate \nto provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for \none resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control. \n•\t\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate \nin the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether \nthe Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating \neffectiveness of such controls.\n•\t\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related \ndisclosures made by management. \n•\t\nConclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit \nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt \non the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required \nto draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are \ninadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s \nreport. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. \n•\t\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and \nwhether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair \npresentation.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit \nand significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements \nregarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to \nbear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance \nin the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore the key audit \nmatters.

"What supplemental information does Meta Platforms, Inc. provide to help investors better understand underlying business trends in their Q4 and full year 2024 financial report, and how do they describe the purpose and limitations of free cash flow in this context?","Meta Platforms, Inc. provides supplemental information in its Q4 and full year 2024 financial report to help investors better understand underlying business trends, particularly through the use of non-GAAP financial measures and adjusted metrics. Specifically, they adjust revenue for foreign exchange effects by translating revenue using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This adjustment is intended to facilitate comparison to historical performance by removing currency fluctuation impacts[1].

Regarding free cash flow, Meta defines it by subtracting both purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases. They explain that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment needed to support the business, regardless of whether the procurement is financed through leases or outright purchases. This approach is intended to provide useful supplemental information to better understand the underlying trends in the business. However, Meta clearly states that free cash flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, highlighting a limitation in interpreting this metric as purely discretionary cash[1].

In summary:

- **Supplemental information includes:**
  - Adjusted revenue for foreign exchange effects to enable better historical comparison.
  - A free cash flow calculation that includes both capital expenditures and principal payments on finance leases to reflect true investment in property and equipment supporting the business.

- **Purpose and limitations of free cash flow:**
  - Purpose: To provide useful supplemental insight into business trends by reflecting the total investment in property and equipment.
  - Limitation: It is not a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary spending, so it should not be interpreted as such[1].

This explanation helps investors focus on operational and investment trends without the noise of currency fluctuations or financing method distinctions, while cautioning against overinterpreting free cash flow as purely discretionary cash availability.","[Document(id='67510745-7531-4a9c-9ed5-7a7486caf3eb', metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 011.001.033', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2025-01-29T20:59:10+00:00', 'source': 'finance_data/meta.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/meta.pdf', 'total_pages': 10, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Meta-12.31.2024 -

"What specific changes or updates did Tesla, Inc. incorporate into its equity incentive plans during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as reflected in the listed exhibits?","Based on the provided context and available exhibits, there is no explicit evidence in the financial statements or the summary of exhibits that Tesla, Inc. made any specific changes or updates to its equity incentive plans during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, beyond the routine issuance of common stock for equity incentive awards and ongoing stock-based compensation expenses.

The financial statements show that Tesla continued to issue common stock for equity incentive awards (21 million shares in 2023, resulting in $700 million in additional paid-in capital) and recorded $2,013 million in stock-based compensation for the year[1]. These activities reflect the ongoing operation of existing equity incentive plans rather than any new or amended plan features.

However, the exhibits do include a new **Clawback Policy** (Exhibit 97), effective November 15, 2023, which applies to certain executive officers and covers incentive-based compensation received on or after October 2, 2023. This policy is not a change to the equity incentive plans themselves but is a related governance measure that affects how incentive-based compensation (which may include equity awards) is handled in the event of financial restatements[1]. The policy requires the recovery of erroneously awarded compensation from executive officers if there is a restatement of financial results.

In summary, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Tesla did not announce or disclose any specific changes or updates to its core equity incentive plans in the listed exhibits or financial statements. The only notable update is the adoption of a new clawback policy affecting executive compensation, including equity-based awards, but this is a separate governance mechanism rather than a change to the incentive plan structure[1].","[Document(id='b24408c5-a06b-4c92-95aa-df09f0e784be', metadata={'producer': 'Qt 5.15.2', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'creationdate': '2024-01-29T11:11:14+00:00',

"Question:  
Based on Apple Inc.’s condensed consolidated balance sheet for the nine months ended July 1, 2023, what was the difference in total liabilities and shareholders’ equity between July 1, 2023, and September 24, 2022?","Based on Apple Inc.’s condensed consolidated balance sheet for the nine months ended July 1, 2023, the total liabilities and shareholders’ equity were as follows:

- On July 1, 2023, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity amounted to $335,038 million.
- On September 24, 2022, total liabilities and shareholders’ equity amounted to $352,755 million.

The difference between these two dates is:

\[
352,755 \text{ million} - 335,038 \text{ million} = 17,717 \text{ million}
\]

These uses of cash were partially offset by the \nissuance of senior notes for net proceeds of $13.4 billion, net cash provided by operating activities of $10.9 billion and net \nissuances of commercial paper notes of $10.8 billion. The net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2024 includes \nthe fiscal 2023 federal tax payment of $2.8 billion that was deferred by the IRS as a result of the California floods and the U.S. \ntransition tax payment of $1.4 billion.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term \ninvestments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our \nportfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high \nquality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to \nuse our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing \nactivities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed \nbelow.\nSecurities Lending  We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt \ninvestments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned \nonly on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that \nthe collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with \nhighly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. \nWe did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. As of \nJuly 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions.\nFree Cash Flow and Capital Allocation  As part of our capital allocation strategy, we target to return a minimum of 50% of our \nfree cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment.

"In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, Netflix, Inc. reported an effective tax rate of 15%. Considering the disclosed schedule of income before income taxes and the reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, what specific components contributed to the difference between Netflix’s expected tax expense calculated using the U.S. federal statutory rate and its actual provision for income taxes for 2022?","To determine the specific components that contributed to the difference between Netflix's expected tax expense (calculated using the U.S. federal statutory rate) and its actual provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we need to consider several factors typically involved in tax reconciliations. However, the exact details for 2022 are not provided in the search results.

### General Factors Affecting Tax Reconciliation

1. **State and Local Income Taxes**: These can increase the effective tax rate due to additional taxes beyond federal rates[3].
2. **Research Tax Credits**: These can reduce the effective tax rate by providing credits for research and development expenses[3].
3. **Foreign Income Tax Rate Differential**: This occurs when foreign earnings are taxed at rates different from the U.S. federal rate[3].
4. **Nondeductible Expenses for Share-Based Compensation**: These expenses can increase the effective tax rate because they are not deductible for tax purposes[2].
5. **Other Adjustments**: These can include various items such as changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities, valuation allowances, and other non-recurring items[3].

### Specific to Netflix

- **Stock-Based Compensation**: In previous years, Netflix has benefited from excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation, which reduced its effective tax rate[2].
- **Tax Avoidance Strategies**: Netflix has historically utilized tax avoidance strategies, which could include leveraging tax credits, deductions, and international tax planning[4][5].

Without specific details from Netflix's 2022 financial statements regarding these components, it's challenging to precisely identify the factors contributing to the difference between the expected and actual tax provisions for that year.","[Document(id='4e284d7a-21d9-4bf8-a492-fa1303ea5820', metadata={'producer': 'PDFBox 1.6.0 (Linux x86_64)', 'creator': 'PDF Engine V2.13(Build on Linux Kernel

"What are the primary sources of Alphabet Inc.'s consumer subscription revenues and how are these revenues recognized over the subscription period in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024?","Alphabet Inc.'s primary sources of consumer subscription revenues include fees from services like **YouTube Premium**, **YouTube TV**, and other subscription-based products. These revenues are part of the broader **Google Services** segment, which also includes income from Google Play, hardware sales, and other services[1][4].

Regarding how these subscription revenues are recognized over the subscription period, Alphabet follows a revenue recognition policy based on the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers. Specifically, revenues are recognized when it is probable that the amount expected in exchange for those goods or services will be collected[1]. For subscription services, this typically means recognizing revenue over the term of the subscription as the service is delivered, assuming the customer continues to pay for the service.

However, specific details on how Alphabet recognizes subscription revenue over the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, are not explicitly provided in the available information. Generally, subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period, aligning with the delivery of the service.","[Document(id='99a66e3d-99a1-44e1-9f68-2421d970d211', metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 011.001.060', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'source': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'total_pages': 99, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'GOOG 10-K 2024', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'page': 57}, page_content='Alphabet Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August \n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (""Alphabet"") became \nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide \nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and \nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated \nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and \nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. \nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our \nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial \ninstruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We \nbase our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the \nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and \nthe collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other \nsimilar taxes are excluded from revenues. \nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n•\nGoogle Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners \nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated \nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n•\nYouTube properties; and\n•\nGoogle Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, \nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google \nDisplay & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nWe offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for \nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues \nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on \na gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed \non Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, \nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we \ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to \nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being \nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n57.'), Document(id='cfd92498-f088-472b-81ac-f680498df165', metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 011.001.060', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'source': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'total_pages': 99, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'GOOG 10-K 2024', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'page': 53}, page_content='Alphabet Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2022\n2023\n2024\nRevenues\n$ \n282,836 $ \n307,394 $ \n350,018 \nCosts and expenses:\nCost of revenues\n \n126,203  \n133,332  \n146,306 \nResearch and development\n \n39,500  \n45,427  \n49,326 \nSales and marketing\n \n26,567  \n27,917  \n27,808 \nGeneral and administrative\n \n15,724  \n16,425  \n14,188 \nTotal costs and expenses\n \n207,994  \n223,101  \n237,628 \nIncome from operations\n \n74,842  \n84,293  \n112,390 \nOther income (expense), net\n \n(3,514)  \n1,424  \n7,425 \nIncome before income taxes\n \n71,328  \n85,717  \n119,815 \nProvision for income taxes\n \n11,356  \n11,922  \n19,697 \nNet income\n$ \n59,972 $ \n73,795 $ \n100,118 \nBasic net income per share (Note 12)\n$ \n4.59 $ \n5.84 $ \n8.13 \nDiluted net income per share (Note 12)\n$ \n4.56 $ \n5.80 $ \n8.04 \nSee accompanying notes.\nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n53.'), Document(id='3d356fa9-85d7-4406-b89f-cd92bb235a17', metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 011.001.060', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'source': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/google.pdf', 'total_pages': 99, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'GOOG 10-K 2024', 'author': 'anonymous', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-02-05T12:22:02+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20250205122202+00'00'"", 'page': 30}, page_content='ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with \n“Note about Forward-Looking Statements,” Part I, Item 1 ""Business,"" Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors,"" and our \nconsolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following section generally discusses 2024 results compared to 2023 results.

We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower \npace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and \nadvertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\n•\nUsers continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which \nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, \nsuch as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no \nmatter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front \nof these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising \nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional \ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues \nmay be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market \nsaturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow \nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (""TAC rate"") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic \nmix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product \nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n•\nAs online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our \nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, \nwe continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our \nproducts and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, \nthat could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user \nexperience and then on monetization.\n•\nAs users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets \ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange \nrates affect such revenues. \nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., \nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our \nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased \nTable of Contents\nAlphabet Inc.\n30.')]",0.07495865970849991,0.0,98
"How does Amazon's exposure to interest rate risk impact its financial condition in 2024, particularly in relation to its investment portfolio and long-term debt?","Amazon's exposure to interest rate risk in 2024 primarily affects its investment portfolio and long-term debt. Here's a breakdown of how these factors impact its financial condition:

## Investment Portfolio
- **Impact of Interest Rates**: Changes in interest rates can influence the value of Amazon's investment portfolio. Generally, higher interest rates can lead to lower valuations of existing investments, while lower interest rates can increase their value. However, specific details about how interest rate changes affected Amazon's portfolio in 2024 are not provided in the available information.
- **Market Conditions**: The overall market conditions, including interest rates, can influence Amazon's ability to generate returns from its investments. With interest rates potentially decreasing, as suggested by some forecasts, this could lead to increased investment values, benefiting Amazon's financial position[5].

## Long-Term Debt
- **Interest Rate Risk**: Amazon's long-term debt is influenced by interest rate changes. The company's debt decreased from $58.314 billion in 2023 to $52.623 billion in 2024, indicating a reduction in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations[1].
- **Floating Interest Rates**: Some of Amazon's committed facilities have floating interest rates, which means that changes in base rates can directly affect the cost of borrowing. Fitch Ratings suggests that base rates are expected to be around 3.5% to 5% over the forecast horizon, which could impact Amazon's borrowing costs[4].

## Overall Financial Condition
- **Interest Rate Cuts**: Potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve could benefit Amazon by reducing its borrowing costs and potentially boosting its financial performance. This could lead to increased cash flow, which Amazon might use for acquisitions or share repurchases[5].
- **Financial Performance**: Amazon's financial performance is influenced by various factors, including interest rates. The company's ability to manage its debt and investments effectively in response to interest rate changes is crucial for maintaining a strong financial position.

In summary, Amazon's exposure to interest rate risk affects both its investment portfolio and long-term debt. While specific impacts in 2024 are not detailed, the company's financial condition is influenced by broader economic conditions, including interest rate changes.","[Document(id='d91e1448-55cd-4672-a291-5bff63c77542', metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2022-02-14T21:08:55-06:00', 'source': 'finance_data/amazon.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/amazon.pdf', 'total_pages': 91, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'Amazon.com, Inc.', 'author': 'T&C Composition', 'subject': 'Annual Report', 'keywords': '25-4123-1_2', 'moddate': '2025-04-09T12:45:58-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20250409124558-07'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20220214210855-06'00'"", 'page': 50}, page_content='AMAZON.COM, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nDecember 31,\n \n2023\n2024\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ \n73,387 $ \n78,779 \nMarketable securities\n \n13,393  \n22,423 \nInventories\n \n33,318  \n34,214 \nAccounts receivable, net and other\n \n52,253  \n55,451 \nTotal current assets\n \n172,351  \n190,867 \nProperty and equipment, net\n \n204,177  \n252,665 \nOperating leases\n \n72,513  \n76,141 \nGoodwill\n \n22,789  \n23,074 \nOther assets\n \n56,024  \n82,147 \nTotal assets\n$ \n527,854 $ \n624,894 \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ \n84,981 $ \n94,363 \nAccrued expenses and other\n \n64,709  \n66,965 \nUnearned revenue\n \n15,227  \n18,103 \nTotal current liabilities\n \n164,917  \n179,431 \nLong-term lease liabilities\n \n77,297  \n78,277 \nLong-term debt\n \n58,314  \n52,623 \nOther long-term liabilities\n \n25,451  \n28,593 \nCommitments and contingencies (Note 7)\nStockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock ($0.01 par value; 500 shares authorized; no shares issued or outstanding)  \n—  \n— \nCommon stock ($0.01 par value; 100,000 shares authorized; 10,898 and 11,108 shares \nissued; 10,383 and 10,593 shares outstanding)\n \n109  \n111 \nTreasury stock, at cost\n \n(7,837)  \n(7,837) \nAdditional paid-in capital\n \n99,025  \n120,864 \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n \n(3,040)  \n(34) \nRetained earnings\n \n113,618  \n172,866 \nTotal stockholders’ equity\n \n201,875  \n285,970 \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity\n$ \n527,854 $ \n624,894 \nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n39'), Document(id='330d8023-8196-40b4-9368-cfcd5e8fe890', metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 15.0 (Macintosh)', 'creationdate': '2022-02-14T21:08:55-06:00', 'source': 'finance_data/amazon.pdf', 'file_path': 'finance_data/amazon.pdf', 'total_pages': 91, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'Amazon.com, Inc.', 'author': 'T&C Composition', 'subject': 'Annual Report', 'keywords': '25-4123-1_2', 'moddate': '2025-04-09T12:45:58-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': ""D:20250409124558-07'00'"", 'creationDate': ""D:20220214210855-06'00'"", 'page': 41}, page_content='Guidance\nWe provided guidance on February 6, 2025, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below.

We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. \nActual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign \nexchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional \nlabor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and \nemerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, \nthe mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the \nextent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, \ninternational growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, \nfulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree \nto which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic \ntransactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical \nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. \nThese risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ \nsignificantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered \nthrough our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, \nand we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from \nitems we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as \nservice sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product \ncategories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, \nand digital content subscriptions.\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by \nincreasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital \nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily \nresult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by \ninvestments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer \nexperience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including \nlowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original \ncontent, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving \nreliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional \ninformation on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product \nand content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, \ntransportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs.
